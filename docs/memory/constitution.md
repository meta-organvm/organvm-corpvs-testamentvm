# organvm Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.1.0 | **Ratified:** 2026-02-10 | **Last Amended:** 2026-03-04
**Source:** `CLAUDE.md` Key Invariants (lines 28-34) + `08-canonical-action-plan.md` §2 stable consensus

## Core Principles (Articles I-VI)

### I. Registry as Single Source of Truth
All repo state lives in `registry-v2.json`. The registry is never wrong; if reality and registry disagree, update the registry or fix reality. No document, workflow, or agent may claim authoritative repo state outside the registry.

### II. Unidirectional Dependencies
Flow is I->II->III only. No back-edges: ORGAN-III cannot depend on ORGAN-II; ORGAN-II cannot depend on ORGAN-III. ORGAN-IV orchestrates; ORGAN-V documents; ORGAN-VII amplifies. Dependency violations are structural failures, not style issues.

### III. All Eight Organs Visible at Launch
Each organ has at least one representative at launch — flagship (fully documented) or stub (purpose, status, and link to parent org). The eight-organ system must be visible in its entirety; individual organs may launch at different completeness tiers per Amendment A. "Visible" means a grant reviewer navigating all 8 orgs encounters evidence of each organ's existence and purpose, not that every repo is complete.

### IV. Documentation Precedes Deployment
No Phase N+1 until Phase N is complete. Documentation is the deliverable, not an afterthought. Every README is written before the feature it documents is promoted.

### V. Portfolio-Quality Documentation
Every README is a portfolio piece, written for grant reviewers and hiring managers, not just developers. The "Stranger Test" applies: a grant reviewer seeing this for the first time should be convinced.

### VI. Promotion State Machine
Repos follow: LOCAL -> CANDIDATE -> PUBLIC_PROCESS -> GRADUATED -> ARCHIVED. This governs cross-organ promotion. Repo documentation status uses a separate vocabulary: ACTIVE/DEPLOYED/SKELETON/EMPTY. No state may be skipped.

## Amendments (Post-Cross-Validation Consensus)

### Amendment A: Bronze Tier Launch Path
*Source: SC-2, D-08 in `08-canonical-action-plan.md`*

The Bronze Sprint produces the Minimum Viable Launch: 5 flagships (one per organ I-V) + stubs for VI-VII + hardened registry + process essay. Completion is criteria-driven (D-08 success criteria), not time-boxed. "5 Perfect Repos > 44 Mediocre Repos."

### Amendment B: Coordination Overhead Budget
*Source: SC-3, B7 in `06-evaluation-to-growth-analysis.md`*

Budget 10% of phase TE as explicit line item for reconciling parallel AI streams. Coordination overhead is real and must not be hidden inside task estimates.

### Amendment C: Registry Schema Completeness
*Source: SC-1 in `08-canonical-action-plan.md`*

`registry-v2.json` must include `dependencies[]`, `promotion_status`, `tier`, and `last_validated` fields before Phase 2. Schema evolves iteratively during Bronze (fields added as workflows need them, locked after majority of flagships are drafted).

### Amendment D: AI Non-Determinism Acknowledgment
*Source: Meta-finding in `THREE_CLI_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md`*

Same inputs produce different strategic outputs across AI models and across time. All AI-generated deliverables require human review. Budget estimates use scenario banding (ranges), not point estimates, to reflect this variance.

## Quality Gates

### Registry Gate
Does this deliverable update `registry-v2.json`? Is the schema satisfied? Are all required fields populated with verified (not aspirational) data?

### Portfolio Gate
Does this README or essay pass the "Stranger Test" (D-08, Copilot validation §7)? Would a grant reviewer seeing this for the first time be convinced? Score >=90/100 on the `01` rubric for flagships.

### Dependency Gate
Does this deliverable respect the I->II->III flow? No back-edges? Cross-references follow the dependency direction?

### Completeness Gate
Are all TBD markers resolved? 0 broken links? No placeholder content in shipped deliverables?

### Amendment E: Post-Construction Operational Shift
*Source: CONSTITUTIO sprint review (2026-03-04), REGULA governance update*

The system has transitioned from **construction** (building, documenting, deploying) to **operation** (sustaining, validating, evolving). Implications:
- Article III (all organs visible at launch) is **SATISFIED** — all 8 organs are operational (launched 2026-02-11). This article now governs any new organ additions, not existing ones.
- Article IV (documentation precedes deployment) applies to **new features and promotions**, not retroactive documentation of already-deployed repos.
- Amendment A (Bronze Tier Launch Path) is **COMPLETED** — Bronze, Silver, and Gold sprints are done. Amendment A remains as historical record of the launch methodology.
- Amendment C (Registry Schema Completeness) is **COMPLETED** — all required fields are present and validated. Schema formalized as v1.0.0.
- Quality gates remain active for all ongoing work. The Portfolio Gate and Stranger Test become increasingly important as external audiences grow.

## Post-Launch Reviews

### Review 1 (2026-03-04) — CONSTITUTIO Sprint

**Reviewer:** @4444j99 (AI-conductor review)

**Findings:** All 6 core articles remain valid and enforced. No article requires modification. The constitution successfully governs post-launch operations as written.

| Article | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| I. Registry as SSOT | ACTIVE | registry-v2.json at schema v1.0.0, 103 repos tracked |
| II. Unidirectional Deps | ACTIVE | 0 back-edge violations. ORGAN-III→VI/VII edges are forward (higher→lower organ flow for community/distribution) |
| III. Eight Organs Visible | SATISFIED | All 8 organs operational since 2026-02-11 |
| IV. Doc Precedes Deploy | ACTIVE | Governs ongoing promotions and new features |
| V. Portfolio-Quality Docs | ACTIVE | Stranger Test not yet executed (omega #2) |
| VI. Promotion State Machine | ACTIVE | 68 CANDIDATE, 12 PUBLIC_PROCESS, 4 GRADUATED |

**Amendments status:** A (completed), B (active), C (completed), D (active), E (new, ratified this review).

**Next review:** After stranger test execution (omega #2) or at 60-day post-launch mark, whichever comes first.

## Machine-Readable Constitution (Dictums)

The `dictums` section of `governance-rules.json` is the authoritative machine-readable encoding of this constitution's structural laws. It encodes three tiers:

- **Axioms (AX-*):** Universal invariants (AX-1 DAG, AX-2 Epistemic Membranes, AX-3 TTL Eviction)
- **Organ Dictums (OD-*):** Per-organ constraints (OD-I through OD-VII + OD-META)
- **Repo Rules (RR-*):** Per-repository requirements (RR-1 Seed Contract, RR-2 SRP, RR-3 Event Handshake)

Each dictum declares enforcement mode (`automated`/`audit`/`manual`) and severity (`critical`/`warning`/`info`). Automated dictums are checked by validators in `organvm-engine/governance/dictums.py`.

**CLI commands:**
- `organvm governance dictums` — list all dictums
- `organvm governance dictums --check` — run compliance validators
- `organvm governance dictums --id AX-1` — show specific dictum
- `organvm governance audit` — includes dictum violations in full audit

**MCP tools:**
- `organvm_governance_dictums` — list dictums (optional `level` filter)
- `organvm_governance_check_dictums` — run compliance checks

## Governance

This constitution supersedes ad-hoc decision-making for the organvm project. All specifications (`docs/specs/`) and planning documents must be validated against these articles, amendments, and gates before execution.

Amendments require: (1) documented rationale with source citation, (2) human approval by @4444j99, (3) propagation to all affected documents per the E2G coherence review pattern established in `09-corpus-coherence-review.md`.
