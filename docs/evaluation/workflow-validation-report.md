**Sprint:** MANIFESTATIO
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Source:** Manual trigger of 4 workflows in `organvm-iv-taxis/orchestration-start-here`

---

## Results Summary

| Workflow | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| orchestrator-agent.yml | PASS | Built system graph from seed.yaml files |
| registry-health-audit.yml | PASS | Audited all registry entries |
| validate-dependencies.yml | FAIL (then fixed) | Detected 2 back-edge violations; fixed in registry + seed.yaml |
| essay-monitor.yml | COULD NOT TRIGGER | No `workflow_dispatch` trigger; runs daily at 09:00 UTC only |

## Detailed Results

### 1. Orchestrator Agent (PASS)

- **Run ID:** 22022506318
- **Triggered:** 2026-02-14T18:50:48Z
- **Result:** Completed successfully
- **Action:** Builds system graph from all seed.yaml files across the 8-organ system
- **Interpretation:** The orchestration layer can discover and map all inter-repository relationships

### 2. Registry Health Audit (PASS)

- **Run ID:** 22022504449
- **Triggered:** 2026-02-14T18:50:39Z
- **Result:** Completed successfully
- **Action:** Audits all entries in registry-v2.json for consistency
- **Interpretation:** Registry data is consistent and healthy

### 3. Validate Dependencies (FAIL → FIXED)

- **Run ID:** 22022504106
- **Triggered:** 2026-02-14T18:50:35Z
- **Result:** Failed — 2 back-edge violations detected

**Validation output:**
```
Total repos: 88
Repos with dependencies: 29
Total edges: 33
Cycles: 0
Back-edges: 2
Deep chains (>4): 0
Dangling refs: 0

FAILED — 2 issues found
```

**Violations found:**
1. `organvm-iii-ergon/tab-bookmark-manager` → `organvm-i-theoria/my-knowledge-base` (ORGAN-III→ORGAN-I back-edge)
2. `organvm-iii-ergon/my--father-mother` → `organvm-i-theoria/my-knowledge-base` (ORGAN-III→ORGAN-I back-edge)

**Fix applied:**
- Removed back-edge from `tab-bookmark-manager/seed.yaml` (remote push via gh api)
- Fixed placeholder values in `my--father-mother/seed.yaml` (remote push via gh api)
- Removed both dependencies from `registry-v2.json` (local)
- Dependency edge count: 33 → 31

**Interpretation:** The autonomous validation system correctly detected violations that were missed during manual Sprint reviews. This is the governance working as designed.

### 4. Essay Monitor (COULD NOT TRIGGER)

- **Issue:** The `essay-monitor.yml` workflow does not include a `workflow_dispatch:` trigger
- **Runs on:** `schedule: cron: '0 9 * * *'` (daily at 09:00 UTC)
- **Most recent scheduled run:** 2026-02-13 (status unknown — may have failed)
- **Recommendation:** Add `workflow_dispatch:` trigger to enable manual testing

---

## System Health Assessment

- **2 of 4 workflows passed** on first manual trigger
- **1 workflow found real violations** and the violations were immediately fixed
- **1 workflow cannot be manually triggered** (needs `workflow_dispatch` added)
- **No catastrophic failures** — the system governance infrastructure is functional

## Blockers Noted

- **GitHub billing lock** on `organvm-i-theoria` prevents CI runs in that org. This affects `recursive-engine--generative-entity`, `my-knowledge-base`, and all ORGAN-I repos. Does not affect ORGAN-IV workflows.
- **Minor:** Python deprecation warning for `datetime.utcnow()` in validate-dependencies script

---

## Follow-Up Actions

- [ ] Add `workflow_dispatch:` trigger to `essay-monitor.yml` for manual testing
- [ ] Resolve GitHub billing lock on `organvm-i-theoria`
- [ ] Re-run `validate-dependencies.yml` to confirm zero violations after fix
- [ ] Replace `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` in validation script
