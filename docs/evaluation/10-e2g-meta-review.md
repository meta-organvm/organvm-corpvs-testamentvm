# 10: Evaluation-to-Growth Meta-Review

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** CAPSTONE — this is the final evaluation document. No further evaluation documents should be created.
**Scope:** The evaluation stack itself (docs 06-09) + the corpus as a whole (78 files, 0 executed deliverables)
**Framework:** Evaluation-to-Growth (E2G) — applied recursively: evaluating the evaluations
**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.6
**Predecessor chain:** `06` (foundational E2G) -> `07` (cross-AI validation) -> `08` (canonical action plan) -> `09` (coherence review) -> **this document**

---

## Premise

The organvm planning corpus has undergone four rounds of evaluation:

1. **`06-evaluation-to-growth-analysis.md`** — foundational E2G analysis with coded findings (C1-C7, L1-L3, R1-R6, B1-B7, S1-S4, E1-E7)
2. **`07-cross-ai-logic-check-prompts.md` + `07-cross-ai-logic-check-results.md`** — three AI models (gpt-5, gemini-3-pro-preview, gpt-5) validating the corpus across two runs
3. **`08-canonical-action-plan.md`** — resolving all contradictions from the cross-validation into D-registers (D-01 through D-08) and stable consensus items (SC-1 through SC-8)
4. **`09-corpus-coherence-review.md`** — propagating `08`'s decisions into the 7 affected documents (~34 edits)

The corpus was then reorganized into subdirectories (`genesis/`, `planning/`, `evaluation/`, `implementation/`, `strategy/`, `standards/`, `specs/`), a constitution was ratified (`docs/memory/constitution.md`), a Bronze Sprint spec was created (`docs/specs/bronze-sprint/spec.md`), and all cross-references were updated.

**The problem this document addresses:** The evaluation stack has never been evaluated itself. Every evaluation so far has examined the *planning* documents (Layer 0-3). None has asked: are the evaluations themselves coherent? Are they producing diminishing returns? Is the ratio of evaluation-to-execution healthy?

**The answer, stated upfront:** No. The corpus contains 78 files and 0 executed deliverables. The evaluation-to-execution ratio is pathological. This meta-review closes the evaluation loop and opens the execution loop.

## Phase 1: Evaluation

### 1.1 Critique

#### MC1: Self-Referential Validation Loop

**Severity: CRITICAL | Status: ACTIVE**

The evaluation chain (06 -> 07 -> 08 -> 09 -> 10) evaluates plans, not execution. Each round finds issues in prior documents and produces new documents to fix them. The output of evaluation is more documentation, never working software or deployed READMEs.

**The loop:**
- `06` evaluates the planning corpus -> produces 7 critique findings, 7 blind spots, 4 shatter points, 7 growth recommendations
- `07` sends `06`'s findings to 3 AI models -> produces 6,004+ lines of validation analysis across 3 directories
- `08` synthesizes `07` into 8 human decisions -> produces a 426-line canonical action plan
- `09` propagates `08`'s decisions -> produces ~34 edits across 9 files + a 297-line audit trail
- `10` (this document) evaluates 06-09 -> produces... more evaluation

At no point does any evaluation round produce a README, a registry fix, a working workflow, or any artifact that exists outside this planning corpus.

**Evidence:** The `docs/validation-runs/` directory alone contains 24 files (~130KB) of AI validation analysis. The main evaluation directory (`docs/evaluation/`) contains 5 documents (06-10). The planning directory (`docs/planning/`) contains 5 documents (01-05). The total evaluation + planning output is ~34 files. The total executed deliverables: 0.

#### MC2: Registry Aspirational Data Persists

**Severity: HIGH | Status: UNFIXED ACROSS 4 EVALUATION ROUNDS**

> **Status update (2026-02-10):** FIXED. Registry now shows `PLANNING`, `0%`, `PLANNED`. All aspirational data replaced with verified state.

`registry-v2.json` still declares:
- `"completion_at_launch": "100%"` (line 14 of summary)
- `"launch_status": "OPERATIONAL"` — 7 instances, one per organ (ORGAN-I line 28, ORGAN-II, III, IV, V, VI, VII)
- `"completion": "100%"` — 7 instances, one per organ
- `"project_status": "All 7 organs operational at launch"` (line 9)

Meanwhile:
- `06` finding L3 identified this: "the registry is aspirational, not descriptive. Any tooling that reads it will get false positives."
- `06` finding E2 recommended: "Remove `launch_status: OPERATIONAL` — replace with actual status."
- `07` cross-validation: all 3 AI models flagged the registry schema as blocking (SC-1).
- `08` D-08 success criteria: "Registry data matches reality for all flagships (no aspirational `100%` or `OPERATIONAL`)."
- `09` coherence review: focused on propagating practitioner comparables, NSF references, repo counts — but did NOT fix the registry data.

**This is the most-flagged unfixed issue in the entire evaluation chain.** It has been identified in every round and corrected in none.

#### MC3: Stale File References in Doc 06

**Severity: MEDIUM | Status: UNFIXED**

`06-evaluation-to-growth-analysis.md` was written before the directory reorganization. Its "Files Analyzed" table (lines 499-531) uses pre-reorg paths:

| Doc 06 Reference | Actual Current Path |
|---|---|
| `registry-v2.json` (at root) | `registry-v2.json` (correct, at root) |
| `ANNOTATED-MANIFEST.md` (in `docs/`) | `docs/ANNOTATED-MANIFEST.md` (correct) |
| `00-a-...-ORGAN-i-vii-sub-ORGANS.md` | `docs/genesis/00-a-system-genesis-transcript.md` |
| `00-b-Organizing-Local-Remote-Structure.md` | `docs/genesis/00-b-local-remote-structure-transcript.md` |
| `00-d-organ-system-audit.md` (in `docs/genesis/`) | correct |
| `07-cross-ai-logic-check-prompts.md` (in `docs/evaluation/`) | correct |

The genesis file references use old filenames that no longer match. Specifically, doc 06 references `00-a-...-ORGAN-i-vii-sub-ORGANS.md` (with ellipsis, line 506) — the actual filename is `00-a-system-genesis-transcript.md`. Similarly `00-b-Organizing-Local-Remote-Structure.md` is now `00-b-local-remote-structure-transcript.md`.

**Impact:** A reader following doc 06's file references would fail to locate 2 of the genesis files.

#### MC4: Doc 07-Results Reads as Active

**Severity: LOW | Status: UNFIXED**

`07-cross-ai-logic-check-results.md` has `Status: COMPLETE` (line 4) and presents an "Executive Summary" and "Action Plan" that were superseded by `08-canonical-action-plan.md`. While `08` §8 explicitly states that `07-results` is "Superseded" and "The 'Bronze Sprint' action plan in §Action Plan is replaced by this document's §3," doc 07 itself carries no supersession banner.

**Contrast:** `09` added back-reference banners to 5 other superseded documents (`parallel-launch-strategy.md`, `orchestration-system-v2.md`, `implementation-package-v2.md`, `public-process-map-v2.md`, `roadmap-there-and-back-again.md`) — but missed doc 07. This is because `09`'s edit manifest was focused on Layer 3 documents; doc 07 sits in the evaluation layer.

#### MC5: Constitution Article III vs. Amendment A Tension

**Severity: MEDIUM | Status: STRUCTURAL**

`docs/memory/constitution.md` contains an internal tension:

- **Article III** (line 14): "All Seven Organs at Launch... The seven-organ system is indivisible: partial organ visibility undermines the portfolio narrative."
- **Amendment A** (line 29): "The Bronze Sprint produces the Minimum Viable Launch: 5 flagships (one per organ I-V) + stubs for VI-VII..."

Article III says the system is "indivisible" and "partial organ visibility undermines the portfolio narrative." Amendment A defines a launch tier where ORGAN-VI and VII are stubs — which is, by definition, partial organ visibility.

The intent is clear: Amendment A modifies Article III's absolutism. But the constitution does not explicitly state that Amendment A supersedes Article III's "indivisible" language. A strict reading of Article III would reject the Bronze tier.

**Resolution needed:** Either Article III should be amended to say "each organ has at least one representative at launch (flagship or stub)" or Amendment A should explicitly state "This amendment modifies Article III's launch requirement."

#### MC6: Evaluation Fatigue — The Planning-Execution Ratio

**Severity: CRITICAL | Status: THIS IS THE META-FINDING**

Corpus inventory as of 2026-02-10:

| Category | File Count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Genesis transcripts (`docs/genesis/`) | 4 | Source material |
| Planning documents (`docs/planning/`) | 5 | Audit framework, inventory, templates, checklists, risk map |
| Strategy documents (`docs/strategy/`) | 3 | Execution index, parallel launch rationale, roadmap |
| Implementation specs (`docs/implementation/`) | 4 | Package, orchestration, public process, GitHub Actions |
| Evaluation documents (`docs/evaluation/`) | 5 | E2G analysis, cross-AI prompts, cross-AI results, action plan, coherence review |
| Standards (`docs/standards/`) | 2 | Repository standards, SDD methodology |
| Specs (`docs/specs/`) | 2 | Bronze sprint spec + checklist |
| Validation runs (`docs/validation-runs/`) | 24 | Cross-AI raw output |
| Meta/config | 10 | CLAUDE.md, README.md, DIRECTORY.md, constitution, agents, .config/ |
| Archive (`docs/archive/`) | 4 | Frozen v1 predecessors |
| Community health (`.github/`) | 4 | COC, contributing, PR template, security |
| Annotated manifest | 1 | Exhaustive per-file guide |
| **Total** | **78** | **Planning, evaluation, governance** |
| **Executed deliverables** | **0** | **No READMEs written, no registry fixed, no workflows deployed** |

The ratio is 78:0. Every file in this corpus is about what *should* be done. None is a completed deliverable.

**Diminishing returns evidence:** Each evaluation round produces fewer novel findings:
- `06` (foundational): 7 critique findings, 7 blind spots, 4 shatter points, 7 growth recommendations = 25 coded findings
- `07` (cross-validation): 3 consensus findings, 3 disagreements resolved = ~6 net new insights
- `08` (canonical plan): 8 D-register resolutions + 8 stable consensus items = refined existing findings, ~2 truly new insights
- `09` (coherence review): 7 inconsistency categories, ~34 propagation edits = 0 new insights (all edits propagate prior decisions)
- `10` (this document): identifying the diminishing returns *is* the insight

The signal is clear: planning has reached completion. Further evaluation produces administrative overhead, not strategic clarity.

#### MC7: Roadmap References Non-Existent Filename

**Severity: LOW | Status: UNFIXED**

> **Status update (2026-02-10):** FIXED. Reference removed from roadmap.

`docs/strategy/roadmap-there-and-back-again.md` line 9 references `09-e2g-corpus-coherence-review.md`. The actual filename is `09-corpus-coherence-review.md` (no `e2g-` prefix). This was introduced during the post-cross-validation banner update and was not caught by the `09` coherence review (since `09` was being written at the time the roadmap was updated).

#### MC8: Feb 17 Launch Target Is Unreachable

**Severity: HIGH | Status: REALITY CHECK**

> **Status update (2026-02-10):** Registry updated with note: "Original target 2026-02-17 is no longer realistic." Live docs still reference Feb 17 — deferred to user decision (see deferred items).

`registry-v2.json` line 6: `"launch_date": "2026-02-17"`. Today is 2026-02-10. Seven days remain.

The Bronze Sprint alone (the *minimum* viable scope) requires 1.1M-1.6M TE of AI generation + human review of 5-7 flagship READMEs. Phase -1 is incomplete (org renames not executed on GitHub). Phase 0 has unchecked items (registry org name updates, repo count reconciliation, orphan classification). No README has been written. No registry field has been added.

The launch date is a planning artifact from the original "all 7 organs at 100%" scope. It was never revised after the Bronze Sprint scoping (D-08 explicitly says "do not fix a sprint count"). Yet it persists in the registry as a hard date.

**Impact:** The date creates false urgency. If taken literally, it demands compressing Phase -1 completion + Phase 0 refinement + Bronze Sprint execution into 7 calendar days — while acknowledging that human review alone (at ~15 min/flagship) hasn't even begun.

#### MC9: Phase -1 "DONE" Claim Is Misleading

**Severity: MEDIUM | Status: PARTIALLY TRUE**

> **Status update (2026-02-10):** Config files updated with eight-organ language, `meta-${ORGAN_PREFIX}` templatized, prefix corrected (`organvum` → `organvm`). GitHub renames/creates still pending (human action).

`06` post-conversion status (line 16): "Org architecture (Phase -1) | DONE"
`roadmap-there-and-back-again.md` Phase -1 checklist:
- [x] Config files created (`organvm.env`, `organvm.env.local`, `organvm.config.json`)
- [x] Roadmap exported to planning corpus
- [ ] All 7 GitHub orgs exist with new names
- [ ] `registry-v2.json` contains zero hardcoded old org names
- [ ] All local git remotes point to new org URLs
- [ ] 8 unregistered ORGAN-I repos classified
- [ ] 3 misaligned repos corrected

Phase -1 has 2 of 7 checklist items completed. The config *architecture* is done — the env-var design, the JSON mapping, the `.env.local` pattern. But the *execution* of Phase -1 (actual renames on GitHub, actual remote URL updates, actual repo classification) is not done. Calling it "DONE" conflates design completion with execution completion.

#### MC10: Evaluation Documents Have Growing Maintenance Cost

**Severity: MEDIUM | Status: STRUCTURAL**

Each new evaluation document creates maintenance obligations for existing documents:
- `08` required `09` to propagate its decisions into 7 documents (~34 edits)
- `09`'s propagation required verification (grep checks across the corpus)
- The constitution (`docs/memory/constitution.md`) must stay synchronized with `08`'s D-registers
- The Bronze Sprint spec (`docs/specs/bronze-sprint/spec.md`) cross-references `08`, `01`, and the constitution
- This meta-review (doc 10) cross-references all of 06-09

The evaluation chain is now 5 documents deep (06-10). Any future change to a planning decision would require tracing its propagation through: `08` D-registers -> `09` checklist -> constitution -> Bronze spec -> this meta-review. That is 5 documents to update for a single decision change.

**This is the evaluation equivalent of technical debt.** The solution is not to add more evaluation documents — it is to stop evaluating and start executing, letting execution surface the real issues that planning cannot anticipate.

---

### 1.2 Logic Check — Internal Consistency of the Evaluation Chain

#### ML1: 06 -> 07 Transition Is Sound

`06` produced coded findings (C1-C7, L1-L3, B1-B7, S1-S4, E1-E7). `07` sent these to 3 AI models for independent validation. The models confirmed the technical findings (registry schema, TE estimates) and challenged the strategic ones (launch approach, portfolio narrative). This is a well-designed validation step: using independent AI models to stress-test a single-agent evaluation.

**Verdict:** Logically sound. The multi-model approach adds genuine epistemic value.

#### ML2: 07 -> 08 Transition Is Sound

`08` took the 3-model disagreements from `07` and resolved them into 8 human decisions (D-01 through D-08). Each D-register cites specific sources from the validation runs, states the contradiction, records the resolution, and provides reasoning. This is good decision documentation.

**Verdict:** Logically sound. The D-register pattern is a reusable governance tool.

#### ML3: 08 -> 09 Transition Is Sound But Incomplete

`09` propagated `08`'s decisions into 7 superseded documents. The edit manifest was organized by priority, each edit was tracked in a checklist, and verification greps confirmed propagation. This is thorough.

**Gap:** `09` focused exclusively on Layer 3 (active planning) documents. It missed:
- Doc `07-cross-ai-logic-check-results.md` (no supersession banner — MC4 above)
- `registry-v2.json` aspirational data (MC2 — flagged but not fixed)
- The roadmap filename reference (MC7 — introduced during the banner update)

**Verdict:** Logically sound in scope; incomplete in coverage.

#### ML4: D-Register Resolutions Correctly Propagated

Spot-checking `08`'s decisions against `09`'s propagation:

| Decision | Propagated? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 (Scenario Banding) | Partially | `08` §3 uses bands (1.1M-1.6M TE). Planning docs still contain point estimates in some places. |
| D-02 (Defer Flagship Selection) | Yes | `orchestration-system-v2.md` launch criteria updated to exploration-first language per `09` §4.1 |
| D-04 (Meta-System First) | Yes | Audience-dependent narrative table added to `08` §7 |
| D-08 (Success Criteria, Not Sprint Count) | Partially | Roadmap Phase 1 description references Bronze scope, but still contains "Sprints 1-2" language (line 253) |

**Verdict:** Mostly propagated. The remaining gaps are minor but illustrate the compounding maintenance cost (MC10).

---

### 1.3 Logos Review — Rational Strength Assessment

#### The Bronze Sprint Rationale Is Well-Reasoned

The argument chain is:
1. All-at-once launch has ~0% probability of simultaneous completion (S1 in `06`)
2. Therefore, define a minimum viable launch tier (E1 in `06`, SC-2 in `08`)
3. Bronze = 5-7 flagships + registry + essay (D-03 in `08`)
4. Completion is criteria-driven, not time-boxed (D-08 in `08`)
5. Specific repos deferred to exploration (D-02 in `08`)

Each step follows from the prior. The logic is sound. The Bronze Sprint spec (`docs/specs/bronze-sprint/spec.md`) translates this into testable acceptance scenarios. This is the strongest rational artifact in the evaluation stack.

#### TE Estimates Lack External Validation

All TE estimates are internally derived. The "token arithmetic" (1 token ~ 4 chars ~ 0.75 words; generation + revision per repo ~ 50-180K TE) is plausible but has never been tested against an actual README generation attempt. The ~13% optimism correction (C7 in `06`) was discovered by comparing two internal estimates against each other, not by comparing estimates against real execution.

**The only way to validate TE estimates is to write one README and measure actual token consumption.** This has not been done.

#### Tiered Repo Classification Is Well-Reasoned But Ungrounded

The Flagship/Standard/Stub/Archive tier criteria (D-07 in `08`) are sensible:
- Flagship: deployed/substantial, 3,000+ words, ~107-180K TE
- Standard: active development, 1,000+ words, ~50-88K TE
- Stub: placeholder, 200+ words, ~12-24K TE
- Archive: empty/abandoned, archive notice, ~8-12K TE

But no repo has been assigned a tier. D-07 defers all assignments to "exploration." The tier framework is a classification system with no classified items. This is architecturally correct (don't pre-classify without evidence) but means the framework's utility is entirely theoretical until execution begins.

---

### 1.4 Pathos Review — Emotional Tone Assessment

#### The Corpus Oscillates Between Ambition and Bureaucracy

The genesis transcripts (`00-a`, `00-b`) convey genuine creative passion — the seven-organ model emerges from an artist-engineer's desire to coordinate complex creative practice. The Greek naming carries gravitas and intellectual commitment.

By the time a reader reaches `04-per-organ-validation-checklists.md` or `github-actions-spec.md`, the artistic vision has been entirely submerged under process engineering. The evaluation stack (06-09) deepens this: each round adds analytical rigor while subtracting emotional resonance. A grant reviewer reading doc 08's D-register resolutions would see governance methodology, not artistic practice.

#### Portfolio Language Assessment: Self-Congratulatory in Places

`registry-v2.json` line 17: `"portfolio_strength": "COMPREHENSIVE"` — self-assigned. No external reviewer has validated this claim.

`registry-v2.json` line 9: `"project_status": "All 7 organs operational at launch"` — aspirational statement written as current state.

`registry-v2.json` line 22: `"strategic_opportunity": "Position the seven-organ system as evidence of: (a) production-ready thinking..."` — the system is not production-ready; it is planning-complete at best.

These are not dishonest — they are future-tense goals written in present-tense language. But a skeptical evaluator (hiring manager, grant reviewer) would read them as overclaiming.

#### What's Missing: The Human Story

`06` §1D identified this: "The corpus remains all architecture, no soul." The evaluation stack did not address this. Four rounds of evaluation have added ~2,000 lines of analytical text and 0 lines of personal narrative. The closest thing to a human story is `08` §7's mention of "12 deployed commercial products" — but even that is a talking point, not a narrative.

The process essay ("How I Used 4 AI Agents to Cross-Validate an Eight-Organ System") exists as a line item in every planning document. It has never been started.

---

### 1.5 Ethos Review — Credibility Assessment

#### Credibility Signals Present

1. **Self-awareness.** The evaluation chain demonstrates willingness to identify and document its own failures (C1-C7 in `06`, S1-S4 in `06`). This is a genuine credibility signal.
2. **Methodological rigor.** The cross-AI validation (3 models, 2 runs, D-register resolution) is a novel quality assurance methodology. It demonstrates meta-cognitive skill.
3. **Env-var architecture.** The `organvm.env` / `organvm.config.json` design is production-quality. It demonstrates real engineering judgment.
4. **Constitution + quality gates.** Governance infrastructure demonstrates organizational thinking, even if it's been applied to planning rather than execution.

#### Credibility Signals Absent or Undermined

1. **"100% OPERATIONAL" in registry.** This is the single largest credibility liability. Any technical evaluator who opens `registry-v2.json` and sees `"completion": "100%"` next to repos with `"documentation_status": "README REQUIRED"` will question every other claim in the corpus. The contradiction between claimed completion (100%) and actual documentation status (README REQUIRED on all 44 repos) is immediately visible.

2. **No executed deliverables.** The corpus demonstrates planning ability. It does not demonstrate execution ability. A hiring manager evaluating "can this person ship?" would find no evidence in 78 files.

3. **Cross-validation methodology is novel but unproven.** Using 3 AI models to validate planning documents is interesting. But it has only been applied once, to this corpus. The methodology is an N=1 experiment. Whether it produces better outcomes than a single thoughtful review is unknown.

4. **Evaluation-to-execution ratio.** 5 evaluation documents (06-10) evaluating 0 executed deliverables. This could be read as thoroughness (planning carefully before acting) or as avoidance (planning instead of acting). Without execution evidence, external evaluators will lean toward the latter interpretation.

---

## Phase 2: Reinforcement — What's Working

### MR1: The Layered Document Architecture Is Sound

The Genesis -> Planning -> Execution -> v2 Active -> Evaluation layering provides clear provenance. A reader can trace any decision from its genesis transcript origin through planning, into the active specification, through evaluation, to the canonical resolution. This is unusually good documentation architecture for a solo project.

**Verdict: KEEP.** The layering should be preserved as the project transitions to execution.

### MR2: The D-Register Pattern Is Reusable

`08`'s D-register format (Contradiction -> Resolution -> Reasoning -> Sources) is a clean decision documentation pattern. It could be extracted as a governance template for future projects. The pattern forces explicit acknowledgment of disagreement before resolution — a discipline most planning processes skip.

**Verdict: KEEP and document as a framework contribution.**

### MR3: The Env-Var Naming Architecture Is Production-Quality

Repeated across every evaluation round: the `organvm.env` -> `organvm.config.json` -> `organvm.env.local` pattern is the strongest technical artifact in the corpus. It solves a real problem (multi-org coordination) with a clean, forkable design. This IS the portfolio piece for infrastructure thinking.

**Verdict: KEEP. This needs no further evaluation — it needs deployment.**

### MR4: The Coherence Review (09) Is a Reusable Process

`09`'s methodology — identify inconsistencies across superseded documents, organize edits by priority, track in a checklist, verify with grep — is a lightweight consistency enforcement process. It could be applied to any multi-document corpus after a major decision change.

**Verdict: KEEP the process. Stop applying it to planning documents.**

### MR5: The Constitution Codifies Governance Minimally

`docs/memory/constitution.md` distills 20+ planning documents into 6 articles and 4 amendments on a single page. This is the right level of abstraction for governance. It could be the first thing a new reader (or AI agent) reads before working on the project.

**Verdict: KEEP, but fix the Article III / Amendment A tension (MC5).**

---

## Phase 3: Risk Analysis

### 3.1 Blind Spots

#### MB1: Zero Execution, Infinite Planning

**Severity: CRITICAL**

The corpus has been in planning/evaluation since at least 2026-02-03 (`registry-v2.json` generated date). As of 2026-02-10, 7 days of work have produced 78 planning/evaluation files and 0 deliverables. Every evaluation round recommends "start executing" — and then the next action is another evaluation document.

**This is not a future risk. It is the current state.** The project is in a planning loop. The loop will not break by producing another planning document. It breaks by writing one README.

#### MB2: No External Reality Verification

**Severity: HIGH**

No evaluation round has verified the actual state of GitHub:
- Do the 8 orgs exist with the `organvm-*` / `meta-organvm` names? (Phase -1 claims 3 renames + 5 creations are "decided" but not "executed")
- Do the 44 registered repos actually exist and contain code?
- Are the repos public or private as claimed?
- Do the `updated` dates in the registry match reality?
- Are there repos on GitHub not in the registry?

The entire planning corpus operates on registry data that was hand-entered, not verified against GitHub's API. The `sync-registry-with-reality.yml` workflow (proposed in `08` §10 T5) has never been built. All 4 evaluation rounds analyzed documents against other documents — none checked documents against reality.

#### MB3: Human Capacity Unexamined

**Severity: HIGH**

`06` finding C2 notes: "The real constraint is not tokens but human review... 44 repos require ~11 hours of concentrated reading." The evaluation chain quantifies AI generation cost (TE) extensively but never models human cognitive capacity:

- How many hours per day can the human operator sustain focused review?
- What is the error rate after 2 hours of continuous README review?
- How does review quality degrade across sequential repos?
- When does the operator typically work? (Weekdays? Evenings? Concentrated blocks or scattered?)

`08` §7 (Copilot finding) warns of "Human review fatigue after repo 15-20" and recommends batching in 5-repo chunks. But no evaluation addresses whether the operator can sustain even 5 reviews per session. The TE budget is precise; the human budget is completely unmodeled.

#### MB4: AI-Conductor Model Unproven for Execution

**Severity: MEDIUM**

The AI-conductor model has one proof point: the TE conversion (278 search-replace edits across 15 files by 4 parallel agents). This demonstrated the model works for *well-defined mechanical transformations*.

README writing is categorically different:
- Requires understanding each repo's codebase, purpose, and positioning
- Requires portfolio-appropriate language (not mechanical formatting)
- Requires accurate cross-references to repos that may not be documented yet
- Requires working code examples that must be verified against actual code

The evaluation chain extrapolates from one data point (TE conversion) to a fundamentally different task type (creative-technical writing). Whether the AI-conductor model works for README generation at scale is unknown. The only way to find out is to try — with one repo first, not all 44.

#### MB5: Evaluation Doc Maintenance Is Becoming Its Own Project

**Severity: MEDIUM**

The evaluation chain now comprises:
- 5 primary documents (06-10): ~3,000 lines
- 24 validation run files: ~6,000+ lines
- Constitution: ~67 lines
- Bronze Sprint spec + checklist: ~100+ lines
- Cross-references between all of the above

Maintaining internal consistency across this evaluation corpus requires its own coherence reviews. `09` was a coherence review of the planning corpus; a hypothetical `11` would need to be a coherence review of the evaluation corpus. This is the evaluation equivalent of Parkinson's Law: evaluation expands to fill the time allocated for it.

---

### 3.2 Shatter Points

#### MS1: Planning Paralysis

**Severity: CRITICAL**

If execution does not start within the next few working sessions, the project risks abandonment through planning fatigue. The pattern is recognizable: the operator has spent 7+ days building an increasingly refined planning apparatus. Each round feels productive (new findings, new resolutions, new structures). But the gap between planning investment and execution output widens with every round.

**The shatter scenario:** The operator returns next week, sees 78 planning files, feels the weight of the system they've built, and decides it's too complex to execute. Or they decide one more evaluation round is needed first. Either way, no README gets written.

**The antidote:** Write one README today. Any repo. Imperfect is fine. The act of executing — producing a real deliverable — breaks the planning loop in a way that no document can.

#### MS2: Code State Unknown

**Severity: HIGH**

The README writing plan assumes repos contain working code that can be documented. But no evaluation has inspected actual code state:
- Are dependencies current or years outdated?
- Do installation instructions work?
- Are there security vulnerabilities?
- Does the code compile/run?
- Are there tests? Do they pass?

If the operator begins README writing and discovers that repo code is broken, the task transforms from "write documentation" to "fix code + write documentation" — a fundamentally different scope with different TE requirements. The `02-repo-inventory-audit.md` scores repos on documentation quality (0-100), not code health. A repo scoring 70/100 for documentation could have completely non-functional code.

#### MS3: GitHub Org Names Unverified

**Severity: MEDIUM**

The entire naming architecture (`organvm-i-theoria` through `organvm-vii-kerygma`) is designed and documented. The env-var templates reference these names. The registry uses these names. All cross-references use these names.

But the actual renames/creations on GitHub have not been executed or verified. If any of the 7 target org names is unavailable (already claimed by another GitHub user), the entire naming scheme needs adjustment — and every document that references the affected org name needs updating. `08` §10 T3 acknowledges this risk and notes it was "largely mitigated by Phase -1 completion" — but Phase -1's GitHub steps are the ones that remain unchecked (MC9).

## Phase 4: Growth

### 4.1 Bloom — Emergent Insights

#### MG1: The Evaluation Stack Itself Is a Portfolio Piece

The methodology demonstrated across 06-10 — foundational E2G analysis, multi-model cross-validation, D-register decision resolution, coherence propagation, meta-review — is a novel approach to document corpus governance. It could be documented as a framework contribution:

- **"E2G Meta-Evaluation: A Framework for Recursive Quality Assurance in AI-Conducted Documentation"**
- The D-register pattern, the coherence propagation checklist, the multi-AI validation methodology — these are reusable tools
- The diminishing returns curve (25 findings -> 6 -> 2 -> 0 -> meta-insight) is itself a data point about evaluation saturation

This is worth exactly one paragraph in the process essay. It does not justify another evaluation document.

#### MG2: Diminishing Returns Signal Means Planning Is Genuinely Complete

The evaluation chain's diminishing returns curve is not a failure — it's a signal. When each round produces fewer novel insights, the planning space has been adequately explored. The corpus has been stress-tested by 4 AI models (Claude Opus 4.6, gpt-5 x2, gemini-3-pro-preview) across multiple evaluation frameworks. The remaining issues are either:

1. **Execution tasks** (fix registry, rename orgs, write READMEs) — these cannot be resolved by more evaluation
2. **Minor maintenance** (stale filenames, missing banners) — these are 5-minute fixes
3. **Structural tensions** (Article III vs Amendment A) — these require a one-line amendment

None of these require a new evaluation document. They require execution.

#### MG3: This Meta-Review Should Be the Capstone

This document (10) should be the final entry in the evaluation chain. The reasons:

1. **The evaluation space is saturated.** 4 rounds + meta-review = 5 passes. Diminishing returns confirm coverage.
2. **The remaining issues are execution-class.** They will be discovered and resolved faster by writing one README than by writing another evaluation document.
3. **The maintenance cost of more evaluation exceeds the insight value.** Each new evaluation document adds ~5 cross-references that need updating when decisions change.
4. **The meta-insight (evaluation-of-evaluation) cannot recurse further.** A review of the meta-review would be an exercise in absurdity.

**Declaration: The evaluation loop is closed. The execution loop is open.**

### 4.2 Evolve — Concrete Recommendations

#### MG4: DECLARE PLANNING COMPLETE

No more evaluation documents after this one. No more planning documents. No more specs, checklists, frameworks, or standards documents. The planning corpus is complete at 78 files. If execution reveals gaps, address them in the context of execution (e.g., if a README needs a template not in `03`, modify `03` — don't create a new planning document about the gap).

#### MG5: Execute — Verify GitHub State, Pick One Repo, Write One README

The first execution step is not "Bronze Sprint." It is:

1. **Verify GitHub org state.** Do the 8 orgs exist? Are they named correctly? (`gh org list` or web UI check — 5 minutes)
2. **Pick one repo.** Any repo with actual code. Preferably one the operator knows well.
3. **Write one README.** Use the `03` template. Apply the `01` rubric. Score it. Fix it until it scores >= 90.
4. **Measure actual TE consumption.** Compare against the `02` estimate for that repo.
5. **Document lessons.** What worked? What didn't the templates cover? What did the actual code reveal?

This single execution produces more strategic information than any planning document:
- Real TE calibration data (validating or invalidating the 50-180K TE range)
- Actual code state discovery (MB2, MS2)
- Template adequacy testing (does `03` actually work?)
- AI-conductor model proof at the README level (MB4)

#### MG6: Fix the Registry Aspirational Data

The most-flagged unfixed issue across 4 evaluation rounds (MC2). Before any Bronze Sprint execution:

1. Change `"completion_at_launch": "100%"` to `"completion_at_launch": "TBD"` or remove the field
2. Change all 7 `"launch_status": "OPERATIONAL"` to `"launch_status": "PLANNING"`
3. Change all 7 `"completion": "100%"` to `"completion": "0%"` (or actual state if known)
4. Change `"project_status"` to reflect reality: `"Planning complete. Execution not started."`
5. Remove or update `"launch_date": "2026-02-17"` — either remove the date or change to `"TBD"`

**Estimated effort:** ~15 minutes manual editing or ~12K TE with AI assistance.

#### MG7: Fix Stale References and Missing Banners

Quick maintenance fixes that should take < 30 minutes total:

1. **Doc 06 genesis file references** (MC3): Update `00-a-...-ORGAN-i-vii-sub-ORGANS.md` to `docs/genesis/00-a-system-genesis-transcript.md` and `00-b-Organizing-Local-Remote-Structure.md` to `docs/genesis/00-b-local-remote-structure-transcript.md` in the Files Analyzed table
2. **Roadmap filename** (MC7): Change `09-e2g-corpus-coherence-review.md` to `09-corpus-coherence-review.md` on line 9 of `roadmap-there-and-back-again.md`
3. **Doc 07 supersession banner** (MC4): Add a banner to `07-cross-ai-logic-check-results.md` directing readers to `08-canonical-action-plan.md`

#### MG8: Resolve Constitution Article III / Amendment A Tension

> **Status update (2026-02-10):** DONE. Article III amended with eight-organ language. See `docs/memory/constitution.md`.

Amend Article III to read:

> Each organ has at least one representative at launch — flagship (fully documented) or stub (purpose + status + link to parent org). The seven-organ system must be visible in its entirety; individual organs may launch at different completeness tiers per Amendment A.

This preserves the spirit (all 7 organs visible) while aligning with the Bronze Sprint reality (VI-VII as stubs).

#### MG9: Mark Doc 07-Results with Superseded Banner

Add to the top of `07-cross-ai-logic-check-results.md`:

> **Post-Cross-Validation Note (2026-02-09):** The action plan in this document has been superseded by `08-canonical-action-plan.md`, which resolves all contradictions from the cross-validation cycle. The findings below remain valid as historical record; the specific recommendations (Bronze Sprint action plan) are replaced by `08` §3.

## Recommended Immediate Fixes

These are the corrections that should happen before any Bronze Sprint execution begins. They are ordered by impact and can all be completed in a single working session (~1-2 hours).

| # | Fix | Ref | Effort | Files Affected | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix registry aspirational data | MG6, MC2 | ~15 min | `registry-v2.json` | **DONE** (2026-02-10) |
| 2 | Verify GitHub org state | MG5 step 1, MB2, MS3 | ~5 min | None (verification only) | PENDING (human action) |
| 3 | Fix roadmap stale filename | MG7, MC7 | ~2 min | `roadmap-there-and-back-again.md` | **DONE** (2026-02-10) |
| 4 | Add supersession banner to doc 07 | MG9, MC4 | ~5 min | `07-cross-ai-logic-check-results.md` | **DONE** (2026-02-10) |
| 5 | Fix doc 06 genesis file references | MG7, MC3 | ~5 min | `06-evaluation-to-growth-analysis.md` | **DONE** (already correct) |
| 6 | Resolve Article III / Amendment A | MG8, MC5 | ~10 min | `docs/memory/constitution.md` | **DONE** (2026-02-10) |

**5 of 6 fixes completed (2026-02-10). Only #2 (GitHub org verification) remains — requires human action.**

*This is the capstone evaluation. The evaluation loop is closed. The planning corpus is complete. What remains is execution: verify GitHub state, write one README, measure reality against plans. The next document in this corpus should be a README for an actual repo — not another evaluation of the evaluation of the plan.*
