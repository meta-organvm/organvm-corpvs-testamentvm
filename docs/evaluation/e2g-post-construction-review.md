# E2G-II: Post-Construction System Review

**Audit date:** 2026-02-16
**Sprint context:** Post-BETA-VITAE (Sprint 27/27), Day 8 since org creation, Day 6 since launch
**Evaluator methodology:** Evidence-driven review using E2G framework. Shift from E2G-I focus ("is the system internally consistent?") to E2G-II focus ("has the system made contact with reality?"). Every claim backed by specific evidence.
**Scope:** Full ORGANVM system — external validation, omega criteria progress, deferred work inventory, operational reality

## Summary Scorecard

| # | Dimension | Phase | E2G-I Rating | E2G-II Rating | One-Line |
|---|-----------|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | Critique | Evaluation | ADEQUATE | **STRONG (internal) / WEAK (external)** | Internal coherence dramatically improved; external contact is zero |
| 2 | Logic Check | Evaluation | WEAK | **ADEQUATE** | E2G-I contradictions resolved; new contradiction: construction addiction |
| 3 | Logos | Evaluation | ADEQUATE | **ADEQUATE** | Arguments strengthened by evidence but untested against real audiences |
| 4 | Pathos | Evaluation | STRONG | **ADEQUATE** | Construction fatigue visible; 28-sprint narrative may alienate |
| 5 | Ethos | Evaluation | WEAK | **IMPROVED but FRAGILE** | Credibility gains from honesty fixes; zero external validation |
| 6 | Reinforcement | Synthesis | ADEQUATE | **STRONG** | All P0/P1 resolved; system is internally sound |
| 7 | Blind Spots | Risk | WEAK | **CRITICAL** | Blind spots have deepened: 7 days of purely internal work |
| 8 | Shatter Points | Risk | CRITICAL | **HIGH** | E2G-I shatter points resolved; new shatter point: the "hermetic seal" |
| 9 | Bloom + Evolve | Growth | STRONG | **STRONG** | Clear, actionable path; omega scorecard provides accountability |

**Overall assessment:** The system has achieved remarkable internal coherence — every E2G-I P0/P1/P2 finding is resolved, the registry is clean, the nomenclature is honest, and a beta product is provisioned. But the post-construction state reveals a deeper problem: **the system is hermetically sealed**. Zero applications submitted. Zero stranger tests. Zero social media posts. Zero products deployed to production hosting. Zero engagement data. Zero external feedback of any kind. The soak test has 1 data point (dry-run mode). The omega scorecard reads 1/17. The next phase must break the seal.

## Phase 1: Evaluation

### 1.1 Critique — Strengths & Weaknesses

#### Strengths Gained Since E2G-I

**S1-II. All E2G-I P0/P1 findings resolved.**
The VERITAS Sprint (Sprint 11) addressed every critical finding: `PRODUCTION` renamed to `ACTIVE` across 82 repos, `revenue: active` split into `revenue_model` + `revenue_status: pre-launch` across all 27 ORGAN-III repos, 9 future-dated essays corrected, all application TODOs fixed, jargon de-translated, and an honesty essay published. This is not incremental improvement — it's a full remediation of every credibility-destroying vulnerability identified in E2G-I.

*Evidence:* `registry-v2.json` (0 instances of PRODUCTION, 0 instances of old `revenue` field), `docs/evaluation/e2g-action-items.md` (all P0/P1 checked), `grep TODO docs/applications/` (0 results)

**S2-II. Sprint infrastructure is mature.**
27 sprint specs in continuous numbering (`docs/specs/sprints/01-ignition.md` through `27-beta-vitae.md`), each with standard format (Objective, Delivered, Key Decisions, Metrics Delta, Lessons). A metrics pipeline (`scripts/calculate-metrics.py` + `scripts/propagate-metrics.py`) automatically calculates and cascades numbers across documents. The sprint catalog (`docs/strategy/sprint-catalog.md`) maps ~60 hypothetical future sprints to 17 omega criteria. This is industrial-grade project management infrastructure.

*Evidence:* `docs/specs/sprints/` (27 files), `scripts/calculate-metrics.py` (generates `system-metrics.json`), `docs/strategy/sprint-catalog.md` (Appendix B: omega mapping)

**S3-II. A beta product exists with real infrastructure.**
`life-my--midst--in` (ORGAN-III) has been assessed, selected, and provisioned: Neon database with 44 tables seeded, 3 migration bugs fixed, auth bug fixed, render.yaml corrected, DEPLOY.md written, all 291 tests passing. The stack (pnpm monorepo, Turborepo, Next.js 16, Fastify 5, Vitest 4) is modern and production-capable. This is the first repo in the system that could plausibly serve real users.

*Evidence:* `docs/implementation/organ-iii-beta-brief.md`, `docs/specs/sprints/27-beta-vitae.md` (migration fixes, test results), Neon project `in-midst-my-life` (damp-mouse-79328625)

**S4-II. Registry schema is clean and honest.**
Schema v0.5 with correct field semantics: `implementation_status: ACTIVE` (not PRODUCTION), `revenue_model` (business model intent) separated from `revenue_status: pre-launch` (business reality). 97 repos registered, all on GitHub. The registry says what it means and means what it says.

*Evidence:* `registry-v2.json` (schema_version: "0.5"), 28 `revenue_model` entries, 28 `revenue_status` entries, 90 ACTIVE + 7 ARCHIVED

**S5-II. Operational infrastructure is built.**
Soak test monitor deployed (`scripts/soak-test-monitor.py`), stranger test protocol written (`docs/operations/stranger-test-protocol.md`), 3 operational runbooks exist (`minimum-viable-operations.md`, `emergency-procedures.md`, `key-workflows.md`), operational cadence document covers daily/weekly/monthly rhythms. The infrastructure for external validation is ready — it just hasn't been used.

*Evidence:* `docs/operations/` (5 files), `data/soak-test/daily-2026-02-16.json` (monitor is running), `scripts/soak-test-monitor.py` (report subcommand available)

**S6-II. Documentation metrics expanded significantly.**
From 28 to 35 essays (~129K words), from 89 to 97 repos, from ~310K to ~386K+ total words, from 10 to 27 completed sprints. The system has grown ~25% in 3 days while simultaneously cleaning up every credibility issue flagged by E2G-I.

*Evidence:* `system-metrics.json` (97 repos, 35 essays, 27 sprints), E2G-I recorded 89 repos, 28 essays, 10 sprints

---

#### Weaknesses (New Since E2G-I)

**W1-II. Zero external contact.**
This is the central finding of E2G-II. After 27 sprints across 7 calendar days:
- Applications submitted: **0** (9 ready, 0 sent)
- Stranger tests conducted: **0** (protocol written, 0 participants)
- Social media posts: **0** (distribution channels identified, nothing published)
- Products deployed to production hosting: **0** (life-my--midst--in beta-ready, not deployed)
- Engagement data points: **0** (soak test running in dry-run mode)
- External feedback received: **0**
- Organic inbound links: **0**
- Community events: **0**

The system is a closed loop. It generates artifacts, evaluates them against its own standards, updates its own metrics, and declares progress. No external observer has interacted with any part of the system.

*Evidence:* `docs/applications/04-application-tracker.md` (Submitted: 0), `data/soak-test/daily-2026-02-16.json` (engagement.total_stars: 0, dry_run: true), omega scorecard (1/17 met, all external criteria NOT MET)

**W2-II. Construction addiction is self-diagnosed but unbroken.**
The operational cadence document (`docs/operations/operational-cadence.md:514-518`) explicitly warns about "Construction Addiction" and sets a guardrail: "NO NEW NAMED INFRASTRUCTURE SPRINTS FOR 30 DAYS." Yet 11 more named sprints were executed after that warning was written (Sprints 17-27). The system diagnosed its own pathology and then continued the behavior. This is the most concerning pattern because it demonstrates that self-awareness does not produce behavior change.

*Evidence:* `docs/operations/operational-cadence.md:514-518` (construction addiction warning), `docs/specs/sprints/17-remedium.md` through `27-beta-vitae.md` (11 sprints after the warning)

**W3-II. Operational cadence Part IV is stale.**
The "IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES" section references:
- `public-record-data-scrapper` as the ORGAN-III beta candidate (Sprint 25 INSPECTIO selected `life-my--midst--in`)
- Week 1 actions for Feb 17-21 that haven't occurred
- The AI-conductor essay as "not yet deployed" (it was deployed 2026-02-11)
- Fit scores that were already corrected in the qualification assessment

The staleness note at line 311 acknowledges this but the content wasn't actually refreshed.

*Evidence:* `docs/operations/operational-cadence.md:411-414` (references public-record-data-scrapper), `docs/operations/operational-cadence.md:342-361` (AI-conductor essay listed as pending when already deployed)

**W4-II. Soak test is nominal only.**
The soak test has 1 data point (2026-02-16), collected in dry-run mode (`"dry_run": true`). The CI section shows `total_checked: 0`. The engagement section shows `total_stars: 0, total_forks: 0`. This is not a soak test — it's a monitoring scaffold with no data. The 30-day clock started today; meaningful data requires 29 more days of collection.

*Evidence:* `data/soak-test/daily-2026-02-16.json` (full contents: dry_run true, 0 CI checks, 0 engagement)

**W5-II. Essay drafts not deployed.**
Two essay drafts (#34 "What It Takes to Ship a Product" and #35 "Twenty-Six Sprints in Six Days") exist at `docs/essays/` but have not been deployed to ORGAN-V `_posts/`. The system-metrics count shows 35 essays, but the public-process `_posts/` directory also has 35 files — these 2 drafts appear to already be counted despite living only in the corpus. This is either a counting error or a deployment that occurred outside the standard workflow.

*Evidence:* `docs/essays/34-*.md`, `docs/essays/35-*.md` (exist in corpus), `ls _posts/` in organvm-v-logos/public-process (35 files)

**W6-II. Application materials may be expiring.**
The application tracker was last substantively updated on 2026-02-16. Job postings are rolling but can close without notice. The Google Creative Fellowship deadline is March 18, 2026 — 30 days away. The operational cadence recommended "Submit Google Creative Lab Five on Day 1 (Feb 17)" — that action hasn't happened. Each day of delay reduces the probability of submission.

*Evidence:* `docs/applications/04-application-tracker.md:5` (Updated: 2026-02-16), `docs/operations/operational-cadence.md:321-338` (Day 1 submit action)

### 1.2 Logic Check — Internal Consistency

#### Resolved Contradictions from E2G-I

**LC1-R.** "PRODUCTION" semantics → Resolved. All repos now use `ACTIVE`. Zero instances of PRODUCTION in registry.

**LC2-R.** Code substance gap → Resolved by re-measurement. MANIFESTATIO revealed the gap was a measurement error (wrong language detection, docs/ prefix trap). 76 repos have code substance; 38 have 10+ code files.

**LC3-R.** Revenue "active" vs. zero revenue → Resolved. Split into `revenue_model` + `revenue_status: pre-launch`.

**LC4-R.** Essay dating anomaly → Resolved. All 9 future-dated essays corrected.

#### New Contradictions

**LC1-II. "Building in public" vs. sealed internal loop.**
35 essays are published to a Jekyll site (ORGAN-V public-process). The tagline is "building in public." But there is no evidence that any external person has read any essay. No social media links shared. No analytics installed. No RSS subscriber count. "Public" in this context means "technically accessible" — not "publicly engaged." The act of building in public requires an audience to be meaningfully public.

*Evidence:* `system-metrics.json` (35 published_essays), `docs/applications/04-application-tracker.md` (0 submitted), `data/soak-test/daily-2026-02-16.json` (0 engagement)

**LC2-II. Operational cadence warns against construction addiction but construction continued.**
Part V of the operational cadence explicitly names the pattern: "The dopamine loop of 'name a sprint → execute it → update metrics → admire the diff' is powerful." It sets a 30-day moratorium on named infrastructure sprints. Then 11 more sprints were named and executed. The document predicts its own violation and the prediction came true.

*Evidence:* `docs/operations/operational-cadence.md:514-518` (warning), sprint specs 17-27 (continued construction)

**LC3-II. Application materials are "READY" but submission count is zero.**
The tracker says 9 applications are READY. The qualification assessment was revised. The submission bundles were created. Cover letters were drafted. But the total submitted count is 0. The gap between "ready" and "submitted" is not a technical gap — it's a behavioral one. The system has optimized for preparation over action.

*Evidence:* `docs/applications/04-application-tracker.md:17` (Total submitted: 0, Ready: 9)

**LC4-II. Beta-ready product exists but is not deployed.**
`life-my--midst--in` has a provisioned Neon database with 44 seeded tables, all 291 tests passing, a DEPLOY.md with clear instructions, and a corrected render.yaml. The minimum deployment config is `DATABASE_URL + JWT_SECRET`. Yet the application is not deployed. The gap between "beta-ready" and "live" is a single deploy action.

*Evidence:* `docs/specs/sprints/27-beta-vitae.md` (all tests pass, DEPLOY.md written), `docs/implementation/organ-iii-beta-brief.md` (deployment plan)

---

### 1.3 Logos Review — Rational & Factual Appeal

**LO1-II. The grant application arguments are stronger but still empirically thin.**
E2G-I noted that applications had no evidence of impact. This remains true. However, the honesty improvements (ACTIVE not PRODUCTION, revenue_status: pre-launch) mean the applications no longer contain falsifiable claims. The arguments are now accurate but unimpressive — "97 maintained repositories with zero users" is honest but does not compel a grant panel.

**LO2-II. The AI-conductor methodology is published and evidenced.**
The AI-conductor essay is deployed (criterion #6 met). The 27-sprint history provides concrete evidence of the methodology in practice. This is the system's strongest rational argument: "Here is a methodology. Here is proof it works at scale. Here is the complete documentation of its application." For technical audiences, this is compelling.

**LO3-II. The beta product adds tangible evidence.**
`life-my--midst--in` with 44 tables, 291 tests, and a clear deployment plan is the first piece of evidence that the system can produce functional software, not just documentation. This significantly strengthens the ORGAN-III commerce narrative. However, until it's deployed and has users, it remains potential evidence, not demonstrated evidence.

**LO4-II. The omega criteria provide falsifiable accountability.**
The 17 omega criteria with clear thresholds (30-day soak, ≥80% stranger test, ≥3 external feedback, MRR ≥ costs) are genuinely falsifiable targets. The current score of 1/17 is unflattering but honest. This level of self-accountability is rare in creative portfolios and could be a rhetorical strength if presented correctly.

---

### 1.4 Pathos Review — Emotional Resonance

**PA1-II. Construction fatigue is visible in the narrative.**
27 sprints in 7 days tells a story of relentless production. But by Sprint 20, the sprint specs begin to read like maintenance logs rather than creative breakthroughs. TRIPARTITUM combined 3 planned sprints into 1. CANON was a catalog reconciliation sprint fixing numbering collisions. PROPAGATIO propagated findings from one doc to another. The emotional arc peaked around Sprint 10-14 (E2G review, portfolio launch, code audit) and has been declining since.

**PA2-II. The "28 sprints in 8 days" claim risks alienation.**
For technical audiences, this velocity might signal capability. For humanities audiences (grant reviewers, residency panels), it signals "machine-generated, not thoughtfully crafted." The honest framing — AI-conductor methodology enabling rapid iteration — is available but needs to be the primary narrative, not the sprint count.

**PA3-II. The naming still resonates but may be overextended.**
Greek/Latin naming (RECOGNITIO, BETA-VITAE, CONCORDIA) maintains the aesthetic but 27 unique sprint names in 7 days strains the metaphor. Each name implies deep significance; the reality of many late-stage sprints is metrics propagation and doc reconciliation. The gap between name grandeur and task mundanity may read as pretentious to external observers.

**PA4-II. The beta product creates a new emotional thread.**
`life-my--midst--in` is the first artifact in the system with potential end-user emotional resonance. The product itself (whatever it does) could generate stories that documentation governance cannot. Shipping it creates the possibility of user testimonials, which are the most powerful pathos evidence.

---

### 1.5 Ethos Review — Credibility & Authority

**ET1-II. Credibility improved significantly since E2G-I.**
The honesty fixes (PRODUCTION→ACTIVE, revenue split, essay redating, M5 honesty essay) have eliminated the most dangerous credibility vulnerabilities. A reviewer examining the system now would find accurate labeling, honest self-assessment, and clear separation of aspiration from reality. This is a major improvement from E2G-I's "CRITICAL" rating on Shatter Points.

**ET2-II. But credibility without external validation is self-certified.**
Every quality assessment in the system was performed by the system's creator using AI tools. The constitution, the E2G framework, the validation scripts, the omega criteria — all designed and evaluated by the same person. This is rigorous self-evaluation, but it is still self-evaluation. External credibility requires external evaluators.

**ET3-II. The "zero submissions" gap grows more damaging over time.**
At Day 2 (E2G-I), having zero submissions was expected — the system was still being built. At Day 8 (E2G-II), with 9 applications READY and 27 sprints complete, zero submissions signals avoidance, not preparation. A reviewer looking at the timeline would ask: "You spent 7 days building infrastructure and 0 days engaging the world?"

**ET4-II. The beta product is the strongest credibility asset not yet deployed.**
Once `life-my--midst--in` is live, reviewers can interact with a real product. This converts the system from "impressive documentation" to "documentation + working software." The credibility delta from deploying one working product exceeds that of 10 more sprints.

**ET5-II. Teaching background strengthens for appropriate roles.**
The qualification assessment (revised 2026-02-16) correctly identifies 11 years of teaching as legitimate customer-facing experience for roles like Together AI Lead DX and HuggingFace Dev Advocate. This reframing is honest and effective.

---

## Phase 2: Reinforcement — Synthesis

### How E2G-I Resolution Changes the Picture

The resolution of all P0/P1/P2 items from E2G-I is a genuine achievement. The system moved from "multiple credibility-destroying vulnerabilities" to "internally consistent and honestly labeled" in 17 sprints. This is the good news.

The bad news is that internal consistency was necessary but not sufficient. E2G-I assumed that fixing credibility issues was the main barrier to external engagement. E2G-II reveals that the barrier is behavioral, not technical: the system's operator prefers building to shipping.

### Claims Now Supported by Evidence

| Claim | E2G-I Status | E2G-II Status | Evidence |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| "97 maintained repositories" | Overclaimed (said PRODUCTION) | **Accurately labeled ACTIVE** | registry-v2.json |
| "Revenue models identified" | False (said "active" revenue) | **Honest** (pre-launch status) | registry-v2.json |
| "35 published essays" | Future-dated anomaly | **Correctly dated** | public-process _posts/ |
| "AI-conductor methodology" | Drafted only | **Published** | public-process/_posts/2026-02-11 |
| "Beta product ready" | Did not exist | **Provisioned + tested** | life-my--midst--in on Neon |
| "Operational runbooks" | Did not exist | **Written** (3 docs) | docs/operations/ |

### Claims Still Unsupported

| Claim | Gap | Required Action |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| "Building in public" | Zero public engagement | Submit applications, post on social media |
| "Working products" | Beta-ready, not deployed | Deploy life-my--midst--in |
| "Community infrastructure" | Zero community events | Host first salon |
| "External validation" | Zero external reviews | Conduct stranger test |
| "Sustainable system" | 1 day of monitoring | Complete 30-day soak test |

---

## Phase 3: Risk Analysis

### 3.1 Blind Spots

**BS1-II. The construction-as-progress illusion.**
Each sprint produces commits, updated metrics, and a sense of completion. But sprints that reorganize internal documents (CANON, PROPAGATIO, TRIPARTITUM) produce zero external value. The metrics pipeline makes internal reorganization feel like forward progress. This is the deepest blind spot: the system's progress metrics measure internal coherence, not external impact.

**BS2-II. Selection bias in self-assessment.**
This review (E2G-II), like E2G-I, is performed by the system's creator using AI tools. The E2G framework was designed by the same person. The omega criteria were defined by the same person. There is no adversarial perspective — no grant reviewer who actually reads the applications, no hiring manager who evaluates the portfolio, no stranger who navigates the repos. Self-assessment, no matter how rigorous, cannot substitute for external evaluation.

**BS3-II. The "ready" trap.**
9 applications are READY. A beta product is READY. Stranger test protocol is READY. Distribution channels are READY. The word "READY" appears throughout the tracker and cadence documents. But "ready" is a state of preparation, not action. The system has optimized for readiness — which is comfortable because it's still building — rather than submission, which is uncomfortable because it invites rejection.

**BS4-II. Assumption that quality ensures reception.**
The system assumes that honest labeling, clean schema, comprehensive documentation, and working tests will be valued by external audiences. This may not be true. Grant reviewers have hundreds of applications. Hiring managers spend ~30 seconds on initial screening. The carefully crafted README may never be read. The system optimizes for depth of documentation; external audiences optimize for speed of assessment.

**BS5-II. No social media presence established.**
The operational cadence planned social media distribution starting Day 3 (Feb 19). Zero posts have been made on any platform. In 2026, creative portfolios and technical projects need discoverability through social channels. The system has no Mastodon threads, no LinkedIn articles, no Discord presence, and no Bluesky posts. The "POSSE distribution" infrastructure exists as configuration, not as practice.

### 3.2 Shatter Points

**SP1-II. The hermetic seal.** (NEW — replaces resolved E2G-I shatter points)
If a reviewer asks: "What external validation does this system have?" the answer is: none. No users, no feedback, no submissions, no engagement metrics. A system that has produced 27 sprints, ~386K words, and 97 repos without a single external interaction could be interpreted as: (a) impressive preparation, or (b) an elaborate avoidance mechanism. The longer the seal persists, the more the interpretation shifts from (a) to (b).

**Mitigation:** Submit one application today. Deploy one product this week. The seal breaks with a single external contact.

**SP2-II. The construction addiction meta-narrative.**
The operational cadence's own warning about construction addiction (Part V) followed by 11 more construction sprints creates a meta-narrative that could be devastating if surfaced by an external reviewer: "The system diagnosed its own compulsive building behavior, wrote a warning about it, and then ignored the warning." This suggests that the governance infrastructure is performative — impressive on paper but not actually governing behavior.

**Mitigation:** This sprint (RECOGNITIO) should be the last internal sprint before external engagement. The E2G-II action items should exclusively prioritize external-facing work.

**SP3-II. The day-count acceleration problem.**
At Day 2 (E2G-I), having zero external contact was acceptable — the system was launching. At Day 8 (now), it's a yellow flag. At Day 30, it becomes a red flag. At Day 90 (the end of the planned timeline), zero external contact would invalidate the entire portfolio narrative. The damage function is not linear — it accelerates. Each additional internal sprint without external contact makes the eventual external engagement harder to frame.

**Mitigation:** Break the cycle immediately. The operational cadence Part IV refresh should make external contact the non-negotiable Week 1 priority.

**SP4-II. Beta product decay risk.**
`life-my--midst--in` was provisioned with a Neon database (free tier, likely) and tested against specific dependency versions. Each day it sits undeployed, dependencies age, the Neon free tier may have inactivity timeouts, and the deployment instructions risk becoming stale. Beta-ready products have a shelf life.

**Mitigation:** Deploy within the next 5 days or establish a deployment timeline with specific dates.

---

## Phase 4: Growth

### 4.1 Bloom — Emergent Insights

**BL1-II. The omega scorecard is the system's most honest artifact.**
1/17 criteria met. This number is uncomfortable but powerful. If presented correctly — "We built a 97-repo system, then built a scorecard to measure our actual progress toward external validation, and the score is 1 out of 17" — it demonstrates a level of self-awareness that most portfolios lack. The scorecard IS the portfolio piece.

**BL2-II. The beta product creates an entirely new category of evidence.**
Every prior sprint produced documentation, scripts, or governance artifacts. `life-my--midst--in` is the first artifact that could produce: user signups, API requests, error logs, performance metrics, feature requests, and customer feedback. One deployed product generates more external evidence per day than 10 documentation sprints.

**BL3-II. The "construction addiction" narrative has standalone essay value.**
The meta-narrative — a system that diagnoses its own compulsive building and then must overcome it — is genuinely interesting content for the "building in public" series. An essay titled "The Construction Addiction: When Building Becomes Avoidance" would resonate with many independent developers and creative technologists.

**BL4-II. Application submission generates immediate external data.**
Submitting one application (e.g., Google Creative Lab Five, which has no deadline) produces: confirmation of receipt, eventual response (accept/reject/interview), and any feedback provided. This is the lowest-friction way to break the hermetic seal.

### 4.2 Evolve — Omega Progress Scorecard

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence | Gap to Completion | Recommended Sprint |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | 30-day soak test passes | **NOT MET** | 1 data point, dry-run mode | 29 more days of data collection | 64 VIGILIA (passive, time-dependent) |

| 17 | 30+ days autonomous | **NOT MET** | 1 day of monitoring | 29 more days | 64 VIGILIA (passive) |

**Total: 1 MET / 2 IN PROGRESS / 14 NOT MET**

### 4.3 Recommended Sprint Sequence (Next 5-10 Sprints)

Based on E2G-II findings, the next sprints should exclusively prioritize **external contact**. No more internal reorganization until at least 3 omega criteria advance.

| Priority | Sprint | Action | Omega Criteria Advanced |
|----------|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **IMMEDIATE** | *Human actions (not sprints)* | Submit Google Creative Lab Five, deploy life-my--midst--in | #5, #8 |
| 1 | **29 DISTRIBUTIO** | First social media posts, essay distribution | Feeds #7, #13 |
| 2 | **30 PEREGRINUS** | Recruit 1 stranger, run test, validate runbooks | #2, #4, #16 |
| 3 | **31 MERCATURA** | Payment integration for life-my--midst--in | #9, #10 |
| 4 | **32 RENOVATIO** | Portfolio refresh with current evidence | #15 |
| 5 | **33 CONVIVIUM** | Host first salon | #11 (partial) |
| Passive | **VIGILIA** | 30-day soak test completes ~March 18 | #1, #3, #17 |

**Key insight:** Criteria #1, #3, and #17 are purely time-dependent (30 days of data). They advance passively while active sprints address #5, #8, #9, #10, #2, #4, #13, #15, #16. The critical path is now: submit → deploy → distribute → validate → monetize.

## Appendix B: Methodology Note

This review follows the E2G framework established in `docs/evaluation/e2g-full-system-review.md` (E2G-I, 2026-02-13). While E2G-I asked "is the system internally consistent?", E2G-II asks "has the system made contact with reality?" The shift reflects the system's maturation from construction phase to deployment phase.

The central finding — that the system is hermetically sealed from external contact — emerged from the omega scorecard (1/17 met), the application tracker (0/10 submitted), and the soak test (1 data point, dry-run). These three data sources converge on the same conclusion: the system has achieved internal coherence but has not tested any of its claims against external reality.

**Finding codes:** S-II (Strength, E2G-II), W-II (Weakness), LC-II (Logic Check), LO-II (Logos), PA-II (Pathos), ET-II (Ethos), BS-II (Blind Spot), SP-II (Shatter Point), BL-II (Bloom)
