## Purpose

ORGAN-VII manages the outward-facing communication of the [organvm eight-organ system](https://github.com/meta-organvm). While every organ produces work that speaks for itself, ORGAN-VII ensures that work reaches the people who need to see it — grant reviewers, hiring managers, potential collaborators, institutional partners, and the broader creative-technology community.

The organ is named *Kerygma* (Greek: proclamation, announcement) to distinguish its function from ORGAN-VI (Community/Koinonia). Community creates spaces for dialogue; Marketing creates channels for broadcast. Both are necessary. Neither replaces the other.

ORGAN-VII implements a **POSSE strategy** (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere): canonical content lives in organvm repositories, then gets distributed to external platforms (social media, newsletters, portfolio sites) with links back to the source. This ensures the system owns its narrative while still reaching audiences where they are.

## Current Status

ORGAN-VII is in the **planning phase**. The organizational infrastructure exists ([organvm-vii-kerygma](https://github.com/organvm-vii-kerygma) on GitHub), but substantive marketing repositories have not yet been created. Content distribution will begin once flagship READMEs and the process essay (ORGAN-V deliverables) provide material worth amplifying.

**Planned repositories:**
- `posse-distribution` — POSSE syndication infrastructure and content pipeline
- `announcements` — Release notes, milestones, and public updates
- `brand-kit` — Visual identity, logos, badges, and brand guidelines

## Planned Infrastructure

### POSSE Distribution
Automated syndication pipeline that publishes canonical updates from organvm repositories to external platforms. Each piece of content has a single source of truth (the organvm repo) and multiple syndicated copies with backlinks.

### Announcements
Structured release communication for milestones across all eight organs. Announcements aggregate cross-organ progress into coherent narratives for external audiences.

### Brand Kit
Visual identity system ensuring consistent presentation across all eight orgs — logos, color schemes (per-organ palette), badge templates, and presentation materials.

## Connection to the Eight-Organ System

| Organ | Relationship to ORGAN-VII |
|-------|---------------------------|
| I (Theory) | Provides intellectual framing for public communications |
| II (Art) | Supplies visual and experiential assets for marketing materials |
| III (Commerce) | Products provide concrete "what we built" narratives |
| IV (Orchestration) | Defines release coordination and communication governance |
| V (Public Process) | Produces essays and methodology documentation — primary marketing content |
| VI (Community) | Community events generate announcements and engagement metrics |
| VIII (Meta) | ORGAN-VII reports to the meta-org umbrella |

**Dependency direction:** ORGAN-VII consumes from all other organs (no back-edges). Marketing amplifies what exists; it does not create upstream obligations.
