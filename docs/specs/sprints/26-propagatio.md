# Sprint 26: PROPAGATIO

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Focus:** Findings propagation and application readiness
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Problem

Sprint 25 (INSPECTIO) produced three significant findings that hadn't been propagated to the rest of the corpus:
1. **life-my--midst--in is the beta product** — but the sprint catalog critical path still said BETA-SCRAPPER
2. **public-record-data-scrapper runs on mock data** — but the portfolio brief said it's "deployed and serving users"
3. **25 sprints now exist** — but the README stopped at sprint 19 in its status table, and the post-launch history narrative stopped at sprint 16

Additionally, the submission checklist had pre-revision fit scores (9/10 for Anthropic) that conflicted with the revised qualification assessment (4/10). Since applications are the highest-ROI immediate action, this mismatch could cause misprioritized submissions.

## Solution

Propagate INSPECTIO findings and corrected metrics across all active documents. Fix fit scores in the submission checklist to match the qualification assessment. Extend the README, omega roadmap, and sprint catalog to reflect the full 25-sprint history.

## Deliverables

### 1. Submission checklist reconciliation (`docs/applications/08-submission-checklist.md`)

- All 7 AI role fit scores updated to match `09-qualification-assessment.md`
- Priority labels corrected: Anthropic FDE from HIGH (9/10) → MEDIUM (4/10), Anthropic SE from HIGH → LOW (3/10), Together AI from HIGH (9/10) → MEDIUM-HIGH (6/10), Cohere from MEDIUM → LOW (3/10), Runway from MEDIUM → LOW (3/10)
- Recalibrated priority queue added at top of document with cross-references to section numbers
- Submission numbering preserved for bundle cross-references

### 2. Portfolio brief update (`docs/applications/00-portfolio-brief.md`)

- Essay count: 29 (~111K) → 33 (~123K)
- ORGAN-III flagship: `public-record-data-scrapper` ("deployed and serving users") → `life-my--midst--in` (feature-complete, selected for beta)

### 3. README sprint history (`README.md`)

- 6 sprints added to milestone status table (20-TRIPARTITUM through 25-INSPECTIO)
- Essay count in Launch Metrics table: 29 → 33
- 10 narrative paragraphs added to Post-Launch Sprint History (17-REMEDIUM through 25-INSPECTIO)

### 4. Sprint catalog updates (`docs/strategy/sprint-catalog.md`)

- Critical path: BETA-SCRAPPER (28) → BETA-VITAE (27) — life-my--midst--in
- Remaining critical path: 42→28→... → 42→27→...
- Category 4 intro: INSPECTIO note added with assessment/brief references
- Appendix B omega #8: "Any of 26–39" → "27 BETA-VITAE (life-my--midst--in)"
- Appendix A total: completed count 17–24 → 17–25 + Sprint 26
- Conventions: sprint count updated to 26

### 5. Omega roadmap updates (`docs/strategy/there+back-again.md`)

- H3 section: INSPECTIO update note added after minimum viable revenue path paragraph
- H3 candidate products table: life-my--midst--in added as top candidate, public-record-data-scrapper demoted with mock data note
- Checkpoint Alpha: essay count 29 → 33, sprint count 19 → 25
- Appendix D: 6 sprint rows added (20-25), totals updated (19→25 post-launch, 26→32 discrete work units)
- Arc of the Sprints: "nineteen" → "twenty-five", sprint list extended, consolidation phase added (17-25)

### 6. Sprint spec (`docs/specs/sprints/26-propagatio.md`)

- This document

## Key Decisions

- **Preserve submission numbering:** The checklist sections keep their original numbers (1-9) for cross-reference with `07-submission-bundles.md`. A priority queue at the top shows the execution order.
- **Don't reorder sections:** Reordering the checklist sections would break the 1:1 correspondence with submission bundles. Instead, the priority note at the top tells the user which order to follow.
- **Update narrative prose:** The omega roadmap's philosophical sections ("nineteen sprints") were updated because they make a claim about the system's current state, not a historical statement about a fixed period. The claim should be current.

## Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Sprint specs | 25 | 26 |
| Documents with stale essay count (29) | 3 | 0 |
| Submission checklist fit scores matching assessment | 2/9 | 9/9 |
| README sprint table entries (post-launch) | 19 | 25 |
| README narrative paragraphs (post-launch) | 16 | 25 |
| Omega roadmap Appendix D rows | 19 | 25 |
| Critical path beta product | BETA-SCRAPPER (unassessed) | BETA-VITAE (INSPECTIO-assessed) |

## What this sprint did NOT do

- Did not build product code (that's Sprint 27+ in life-my--midst--in repo)
- Did not submit applications (human work per checklist)
- Did not change registry-v2.json (no status changes)
- Did not create new infrastructure (AP-1 compliant)
- Did not rewrite history — added update notes and propagated existing findings
