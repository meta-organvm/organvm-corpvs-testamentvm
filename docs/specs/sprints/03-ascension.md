# Sprint 3: ASCENSION -- Promotions, CI Fixes, and New Art Repos

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Category:** Construction (promotions + new repos)

## Objective
Continue repo promotions, fix accumulated CI failures, and create new ORGAN-II art-from repositories to establish the creative pipeline from ORGAN-I theory.

## Delivered
- 12 additional repo promotions to ACTIVE
- 3 CI workflow fixes across failing repos
- art-from--recursive-engine created in ORGAN-II and deployed to ACTIVE
- art-from--lingua-franca created in ORGAN-II and deployed to ACTIVE
- Dependabot alerts triaged across all organizations

## Key Decisions
- Created art-from repos to establish ORGAN-II creative pipeline from ORGAN-I theory outputs
- Addressed CI failures before executing more promotions to avoid compounding problems
- Triaged Dependabot alerts as ongoing maintenance rather than deferring

## Metrics Delta
- ACTIVE repos: +12
- New repos: +2
- CI fixes: 3

## Lessons
- CI failures accumulate silently during batch operations; periodic CI health checks should be part of every sprint.
- Dependabot triage is ongoing maintenance, not a one-time task.
