# Sprint 20: TRIPARTITUM — Combined REMEDIUM + MEMORIA + ANNOTATIO

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Category:** Infrastructure Repair / Documentation Completion

## Objective
Combine three sprint-catalog items into a single execution pass: verify REMEDIUM resolution, correct stale metrics across all active corpus documents (MEMORIA), and write retrospective specs for all 19 completed sprints (ANNOTATIO).

## Delivered
- REMEDIUM verification: all 5 orchestration workflows confirmed healthy; sprint-catalog updated with detailed diagnosis (phantom failures, already-replaced CI, correct SKIPPED behavior)
- MEMORIA: 13 files updated — all active documents now reflect 97 repos, 90 ACTIVE, 7 ARCHIVED, correct org counts (I=20, II=30, III=27, IV=7, V=2, VI=4, VII=4, Meta=3), ACTIVE terminology (not PRODUCTION)
- ANNOTATIO: 19 sprint retrospective specs written in `docs/specs/sprints/` (Gap-Fill through CONCORDIA)
- praxis-validate.py: 12/12 checks pass

## Key Decisions
- Combined three catalog items into one sprint rather than executing separately — the three were complementary (REMEDIUM was already resolved, MEMORIA and ANNOTATIO were pure documentation)
- Preserved historical analysis in e2g-full-system-review.md while adding resolution annotations rather than rewriting history
- Reworked operational-cadence.md's SKELETON section as "low-code repos" rather than just swapping numbers — the entire premise had changed

## Metrics Delta
- Stale references eliminated: ~70 edits across 13 files
- Sprint specs: 0 → 19 (in `docs/specs/sprints/`)
- All active documents now aligned with registry-v2.json
- Files changed: 32 (13 modified + 19 created)

## Lessons
Stale data compounds — once registry changes (VERITAS renamed PRODUCTION→ACTIVE, CONCORDIA added 6 repos), every downstream document drifts further from truth. Periodic reconciliation sweeps (MEMORIA-style) are cheaper than fixing individual documents ad hoc. The three-way combination worked well because REMEDIUM was already resolved (diagnosis only) and MEMORIA + ANNOTATIO had no code dependencies on each other.
