# Sprint: GAP-FILL -- Coverage Completion Across All Eight Organs

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Category:** Construction

## Objective
Fill architectural gaps revealed by launch audit, ensuring every organ has minimum viable representation with documented repositories.

## Delivered
- 11 new repositories created to fill structural gaps
- 14 READMEs deployed across new and existing repos
- 14 tier promotions executed (SKELETON/DESIGN_ONLY to higher tiers)
- Total documentation reached ~270K words

## Key Decisions
- Created repos to ensure every organ had minimum representation rather than deepening existing repos
- Prioritized coverage breadth over individual repo depth
- Used registry-v2.json gap analysis to identify missing slots systematically

## Metrics Delta
- Repos: 66 to 77
- READMEs deployed: +14
- Total words: ~250K to ~270K

## Lessons
- Coverage gaps become visible only after initial launch; a post-launch audit pass should be standard practice.
- Having the registry as single source of truth made identifying and prioritizing gaps systematic rather than ad hoc.
