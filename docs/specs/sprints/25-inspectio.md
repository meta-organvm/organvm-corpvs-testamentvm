# Sprint 25: INSPECTIO

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Focus:** ORGAN-III product assessment and beta candidate selection
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Problem

Revenue is $0. H3 (generate revenue) is the most underdeveloped omega horizon. 24 sprints of documentation and infrastructure are complete, but no product work has been done. The operational cadence Part IV (Days 4-5) specifies "Select ORGAN-III Beta Product" as a critical early action. The system cannot generate revenue without a concrete product selection and development plan.

## Solution

Assess the 5 highest-code-substance ORGAN-III repos across 10 dimensions (tech stack, feature completeness, deployment readiness, test coverage, UI state, revenue model fit, time to beta, etc.) and produce a structured comparison with a clear BUILD/DEFER/INVESTIGATE recommendation for each. Write a 1-page product brief for the recommended candidate answering all 8 questions from the operational cadence template.

## Deliverables

### 1. ORGAN-III Beta Assessment (`docs/implementation/organ-iii-beta-assessment.md`)

- Structured assessment of 5 repos: life-my--midst--in (1,694 files), universal-mail--automation (1,272 files), public-record-data-scrapper (497 files), classroom-rpg-aetheria (211 files), fetch-familiar-friends (188 files)
- Summary comparison table across all 10 dimensions
- Individual deep-dive sections with tech stack, feature completeness, deployment readiness, test coverage, revenue model analysis
- Final ranking with recommendations: 1 BUILD, 1 INVESTIGATE, 3 DEFER
- **Winner: life-my--midst--in** — feature-complete, production-grade, 1-2 weeks to live beta

### 2. Product Brief (`docs/implementation/organ-iii-beta-brief.md`)

- Target user persona (Portfolio Professionals + Hiring Managers)
- Core value proposition ("Your professional identity, curated by context")
- MVP feature set (5 features for beta)
- Tech stack and deployment plan (Railway + Vercel, ~$17-25/month)
- Revenue model (freemium: Free/$12/$29 tiers)
- Gap analysis (core product complete, gaps are SaaS plumbing: auth, payments, marketing)
- Timeline (3 weeks to public beta)
- First 10 users strategy (personal network, public-process readers, Mastodon, application reviewers)

### 3. Operational Cadence Update (`docs/operations/operational-cadence.md`)

- Added staleness note to Part IV header acknowledging that concrete actions are as-of Feb 16
- Points readers to updated application tracker and ORGAN-III beta assessment
- Does NOT rewrite Part IV (CANON principle: don't rewrite history, add pointers)

### 4. Sprint Spec (`docs/specs/sprints/25-inspectio.md`)

## Key Decisions

- **life-my--midst--in over public-record-data-scrapper:** Both are strong candidates. life-my--midst--in won because it's feature-complete (zero open issues, 68+ commits) with comprehensive deployment infrastructure (Docker, Helm, K8s, Railway, Render, Vercel). public-record-data-scrapper has better market fit (B2B lead gen) but runs on mock data — it's a sophisticated demo, not a product yet.
- **Assessment-only, no registry changes:** This sprint produces a decision, not a deployment. No `registry-v2.json` entries are modified. Implementation status changes will happen when actual product work begins.
- **AP-1 compliance:** This sprint is product assessment, not infrastructure building. It produces artifacts that enable Tuesday product work per the operational cadence, not new systems.

## Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Sprint specs | 24 | 25 |
| ORGAN-III beta candidate selected | No | Yes (life-my--midst--in) |
| Product brief written | No | Yes |
| Revenue | $0 | $0 (unchanged — this sprint assesses, next sprints build) |

## What this sprint did NOT do

- Did not build any product code (that's Tuesday product work)
- Did not deploy anything to a hosting provider
- Did not run tests in ORGAN-III repos (read-only assessment)
- Did not change any registry entries (assessment only)
- Did not create new infrastructure (AP-1 compliant)
- Did not touch any ORGAN-III repo files (all output is in this corpus)
