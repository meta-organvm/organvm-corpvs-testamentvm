# Sprint 28: RECOGNITIO

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Focus:** E2G-II post-construction system review
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Problem

27 sprints have been completed across 7 calendar days. All P0/P1/P2 findings from the original E2G review (Sprint 10, PRAXIS) are resolved. The system has grown from 89 to 97 repos, 28 to 35 essays, and gained a metrics automation pipeline, a provisioned Neon database, and a beta-ready product. But a structural gap has emerged: **every sprint has been internal**. Zero applications submitted. Zero stranger tests conducted. Zero social media posts. Zero products deployed to production hosting. The soak test has 1 data point. The omega scorecard reads 1/17.

The system is internally coherent but hermetically sealed from external reality.

## Solution

Apply the same E2G framework from Sprint 10 to the post-construction state, shifting the lens from "is the system internally consistent?" to "has the system made contact with reality?" Produce a prioritized remediation roadmap that sequences the next 5-10 sprints around external contact.

## Deliverables

### 1. E2G-II Review (`docs/evaluation/e2g-post-construction-review.md`)

Full 9-dimension review following the same framework as E2G-I:
- **Critique:** Internal coherence dramatically improved (STRONG); external contact is zero (WEAK)
- **Logic Check:** E2G-I contradictions resolved; new contradiction: construction addiction warned but unbroken
- **Logos:** Arguments strengthened by evidence but untested against real audiences
- **Pathos:** Construction fatigue visible; 28-sprint narrative risks alienation
- **Ethos:** Credibility gains from honesty fixes; zero external validation
- **Reinforcement:** All P0/P1 resolved; system is internally sound
- **Blind Spots:** CRITICAL — blind spots have deepened from 7 days of purely internal work
- **Shatter Points:** Hermetic seal is the new #1 shatter point (replaces resolved E2G-I points)
- **Bloom + Evolve:** Omega scorecard (1/17) with full status table and sprint sequence

### 2. E2G-II Action Items (`docs/evaluation/e2g-ii-action-items.md`)

- **4 P0 items:** Human actions to break the hermetic seal (submit Creative Lab Five, deploy life-my--midst--in, submit 2 job apps, first social media post)
- **5 P1 items:** Strengthen external engagement within 2 sprints
- **6 P2 items:** System quality improvements within 5 sprints
- **6 P3 items:** Strategic items over 1+ month
- Full E2G-I status reconciliation (11 resolved, 1 superseded, 4 open, 1 in progress)

### 3. Omega Progress Scorecard (embedded in E2G-II review, Section 4.2)

All 17 criteria assessed:
- **1 MET:** #6 (AI-conductor essay published)
- **2 IN PROGRESS:** #8 (beta product — provisioned, not deployed), #15 (portfolio — exists, not refreshed)
- **14 NOT MET:** All require external contact

### 4. Updated Critical Path (`docs/strategy/sprint-catalog.md` Appendix D)

- BETA-VITAE marked complete
- Remaining path reordered to front-load external contact
- E2G-II priority sequence: immediate human actions → DISTRIBUTIO → PEREGRINUS → MERCATURA → RENOVATIO → CONVIVIUM
- Omega scorecard summary added

### 5. Refreshed Operational Cadence Part IV (`docs/operations/operational-cadence.md`)

- Replaced stale Checkpoint Alpha content with current priorities
- ORGAN-III beta candidate: life-my--midst--in (not public-record-data-scrapper)
- Fit scores aligned with qualification assessment
- AI-conductor essay noted as already deployed
- "Non-negotiable rule" added: no internal sprints until P0 actions complete
- Dropped ineligible targets (Knight Foundation, Mellon, NEA)

### 6. Sprint spec (`docs/specs/sprints/28-recognitio.md`)

This document.

## Key Decisions

- **E2G-II as final internal sprint:** This sprint explicitly positions itself as the last permitted internal sprint before external engagement begins. The P0 action items are human actions (browser + submit), not sprint tasks.
- **Omega scorecard as central artifact:** Rather than burying the 1/17 score, the E2G-II review leads with it. The uncomfortable number IS the portfolio piece — demonstrating accountability.
- **"Hermetic seal" framing:** Named the core finding clearly to make it undeniable. The system can no longer rationalize internal reorganization as progress.
- **Deferred items consolidated:** The 25-item deferred inventory from all 27 sprints was compiled by reviewing every sprint spec. This prevents "forgotten" items from silently accumulating.

## Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Sprint specs | 27 | 28 |
| E2G reviews | 1 | 2 |
| E2G action item documents | 1 | 2 |
| Omega criteria assessed | 0 (no formal scorecard) | 17/17 assessed |
| Omega criteria MET | 1 (informal) | 1 (formally scored) |
| Operational cadence Part IV | Stale (Checkpoint Alpha) | Current (E2G-II refresh) |
| Critical path sprints remaining | 10 (per PROPAGATIO) | 8 + immediate human actions |

## What this sprint did NOT do

- Did not submit any applications (that is P0 human work per E2G-II action items)
- Did not deploy life-my--midst--in (that is P0 human work)
- Did not make any social media posts (that is P0 human work)
- Did not run the soak test in non-dry-run mode (P1 item E2)
- Did not modify registry-v2.json (no status changes)
- Did not create any new infrastructure (assessment and documentation only)
- Did not write new essays (assessment sprint, not content sprint)

## Lessons

- **Self-awareness does not equal behavior change.** The operational cadence warned about construction addiction. 11 more sprints followed. Naming a pattern is necessary but not sufficient — behavioral guardrails (like the P0 gate) are required.
- **The omega scorecard is the most powerful accountability tool in the system.** A single number (1/17) cuts through the narrative of "27 sprints completed." It measures what matters (external validation) rather than what's comfortable (internal coherence).
- **Deferred items accumulate invisibly.** Only by reading all 27 sprint specs did the 25-item deferred inventory emerge. Many items were silently carried forward without explicit tracking. The E2G-II action items now provide a consolidated view.
