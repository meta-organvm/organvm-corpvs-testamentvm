# Sprint 5: PERFECTION -- Portfolio Expansion to All Eight Organs

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Category:** Portfolio & Presentation

## Objective
Expand the portfolio site to represent all 8 organs with curated project pages, integrate orphan pages, and update all stale statistics.

## Delivered
- Portfolio projects expanded from 14 to 20 curated entries
- Organs V, VI, VII (previously absent) received dedicated project pages
- Orphan pages integrated into organ group structure
- All stale statistics updated across portfolio
- Meta-README expanded to 3,000+ words

## Key Decisions
- Expanded portfolio to show all 8 organs rather than only code-heavy ones (I, II, III)
- Integrated orphan project pages into organ structure rather than deleting them
- Treated the meta-README as a portfolio piece in its own right

## Metrics Delta
- Portfolio projects: 14 to 20
- Organ coverage in portfolio: 5 to 8
- Meta-README: expanded to 3,000+ words

## Lessons
- Portfolio completeness matters more than individual project depth for grant and hiring audiences; showing breadth signals system-level thinking.
- Non-code organs (community, marketing, public process) need representation even when their repos are documentation-only.
