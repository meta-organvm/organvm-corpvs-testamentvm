# Sprint 2: PROPULSION -- Largest Batch Promotion

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Category:** Construction (batch promotion)

## Objective
Execute the largest single batch promotion of repositories from PROTOTYPE to ACTIVE, cleaning up stale CI and updating application materials.

## Delivered
- 17 repos promoted from PROTOTYPE to ACTIVE
- Stale CI configurations cleaned up across promoted repos
- All application materials updated with current metrics

## Key Decisions
- Promoted in bulk rather than one-by-one to maintain momentum
- Set threshold criteria for PROTOTYPE to ACTIVE: README present, CI passing, description set
- Updated application materials immediately after promotion to keep metrics current

## Metrics Delta
- ACTIVE repos: +17
- PROTOTYPE repos: -17
- Application materials: refreshed with current counts

## Lessons
- Batch promotion is efficient but risks promoting repos that do not genuinely meet quality standards; a validation pass after bulk changes is essential.
- Explicit threshold criteria prevent subjective promotion decisions and make the process repeatable.
