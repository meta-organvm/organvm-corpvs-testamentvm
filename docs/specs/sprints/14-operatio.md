# Sprint 14: OPERATIO — Operational Readiness and Post-Construction Governance

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~8 hours
**Category:** Infrastructure Repair / Documentation Completion

## Objective
Transition from construction to steady-state operations by building monitoring, runbooks, and the post-construction governance framework.

## Delivered
- 30-day soak test monitor built (scripts/soak-test-monitor.py) and started
- 3 operational runbooks written: minimum viable operations, emergency procedures, key workflows
- Stranger test protocol drafted
- AI-conductor methodology essay drafted (4,000+ words)
- Post-construction governance triangle: omega roadmap + operational cadence + sprint catalog

## Key Decisions
- Wrote 3 separate runbooks (MVO, emergency, key workflows) rather than one monolithic operations guide
- Designed soak test as passive daily snapshots rather than active testing
- Created governance triangle of 3 complementary documents (destination + rhythm + menu)

## Metrics Delta
- Runbooks: 0 → 3
- Soak test: started (Day 1 of 30)
- Governance docs: 0 → 3
- Essay drafts: +1 (AI-conductor methodology, 4,000+ words)

## Lessons
The transition from construction to operation requires explicit documentation of what "normal" looks like. The governance triangle (destination + rhythm + menu) prevents both aimless drift and compulsive sprint-naming.
