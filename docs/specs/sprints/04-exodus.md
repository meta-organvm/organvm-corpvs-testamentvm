# Sprint 4: EXODUS -- Application Prep and Final Promotions

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Category:** External Validation (application prep)

## Objective
Complete final repo promotions and prepare nine audience-specific application bundles for AI roles, grants, and residencies.

## Delivered
- commerce--meta promoted to ACTIVE, bringing total to 84 ACTIVE repos (92.3%)
- All application materials updated (~386K+ words, 82+ CI workflows, 29 essays)
- 9 application bundles finalized as submission-ready
- 3 audience tracks defined: AI roles, grants, residencies

## Key Decisions
- Created 3 audience tracks with 9 tailored submission bundles rather than a single generic package
- Led with different evidence for each audience (technical depth for AI roles, impact narrative for grants, creative vision for residencies)
- Froze metrics at current numbers for application consistency

## Metrics Delta
- ACTIVE repos: to 84 (92.3%)
- Application bundles: 0 to 9
- Audience tracks: 0 to 3

## Lessons
- Application materials need audience-specific framing; the same evidence reads differently to hiring managers vs. grant reviewers.
- Having comprehensive metrics (word counts, repo counts, CI coverage) makes application claims verifiable.
