## How to Use This Document

**When:** Every Friday during the Part I retrospective block (see [`operational-cadence.md`](./operational-cadence.md) Part I).

**What to do:**
1. Scan READY — can anything be knocked out this week?
2. Scan NEEDS TIME — schedule blocks for next week's deep work days
3. Check NEEDS INCOME / NEEDS EXTERNAL — has anything unblocked?
4. Move completed items to COMPLETED with a date
5. Add any new items discovered during the week
6. At monthly review (Week 4), archive completed items

**Constraint tags:**
- `[READY]` — No blockers. Just needs doing. Quick wins (<30 min).
- `[TIME]` — Needs a scheduled block (>30 min). No other blocker.
- `[INCOME]` — Requires spending money (hosting, subscriptions, paid tools).
- `[EXTERNAL]` — Waiting on someone or something outside your control.

**Item IDs** use the e2g-ii codes where they exist (X1, E2, M3-II, S1-II, etc.) and new codes (G1, G2, G3) for setup-guide items. This preserves provenance and makes cross-referencing painless.

*This document was created on 2026-02-17 as the fourth governance document, completing the quadrilateral: roadmap (destination) + catalog (menu) + cadence (rhythm) + rolling TODO (queue). Review weekly at Friday retrospective. Items that persist for 3+ months without progress should be reassessed — they may belong in the catalog's unscheduled list rather than the active queue.*
