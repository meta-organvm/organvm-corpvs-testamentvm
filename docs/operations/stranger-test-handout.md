**Time required:** ~60 minutes (5 tasks + brief feedback)
**What you need:** A laptop with a browser. No special tools required.

## Your Starting Point

**https://github.com/meta-organvm**

This is the entry point to a system you haven't seen before. You'll complete 5 tasks that test whether the system's public documentation makes sense to someone encountering it cold. There are no trick questions. If something is hard to find or confusing, that's useful information — it tells us what to improve.

**Rules:**
- Use only what you can find through public GitHub pages, READMEs, and linked websites
- Think aloud if you're comfortable doing so (helps us understand your process)
- If you're stuck on a task, say so and move to the next one — getting stuck is data, not failure

## Task 1: What Is This? (10 minutes)

Starting from https://github.com/meta-organvm, figure out what this system is and what it's for.

**Write 2-3 sentences describing it.**

---

## Task 2: Find the Flagship (8 minutes)

ORGAN-III is the "commerce" organ. Find its flagship repository — the most important repo in that organ.

**Name the repo and explain what it does in 1-2 sentences.**

---

## Task 3: Explain the Rules (10 minutes)

The system has rules about which organs can depend on which other organs. Find these rules.

**Explain the key constraint in one sentence.**

---

## Task 4: Find a Specific Essay (6 minutes)

The system includes essays published on a public blog. Find the essay that discusses AI transparency or honesty in how the system was built.

**Provide its title or URL.**

---

## Task 5: Is This System Alive? (12 minutes)

Look at the system and assess: does it seem healthy and actively maintained, or does it seem abandoned?

**Give 3 specific pieces of evidence for your assessment.**

## Feedback (after all tasks)

### Rate each on a scale of 1-5:

| Question | Your Rating |
|----------|-------------|
| How clear was the system's purpose? (1=unclear, 5=obvious) | |
| How easy was it to find things? (1=lost, 5=intuitive) | |
| How well-written were the docs you read? (1=confusing, 5=excellent) | |
| Did the system feel coordinated or scattered? (1=scattered, 5=coordinated) | |
| Does this seem like a real, maintained project? (1=abandoned, 5=clearly real) | |

### Open-ended:

1. What was the single most confusing thing you encountered?
2. What would have helped you most in the first 5 minutes?
3. If you had to explain this system to a colleague in one sentence, what would you say?
4. Would you star, fork, or bookmark any of the repos you saw? Which ones and why?
5. Any other observations, frustrations, or suggestions?
