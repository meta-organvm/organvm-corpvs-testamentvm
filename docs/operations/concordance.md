> *Every governance document uses short IDs. This document resolves all of them in one place. When you encounter "X1" or "AP-3" or "#8" — look here.*

---

## How to Use

**In conversation:** Ask Claude "what's X1?" or "which items advance #8" — the CLAUDE.md invocation table teaches it to check here.

**In terminal:** `python3 scripts/invoke.py <ID>` resolves any ID to its definition, source, and related IDs.

```bash
python3 scripts/invoke.py X1                  # lookup single ID
python3 scripts/invoke.py X1 E3 AP-2          # lookup multiple IDs
python3 scripts/invoke.py --namespace todo     # list all TODO items
python3 scripts/invoke.py --namespace omega    # list all omega criteria
python3 scripts/invoke.py --tag INCOME         # filter by constraint tag
python3 scripts/invoke.py --search "stranger"  # full-text search across definitions
python3 scripts/invoke.py --list               # list all namespaces and counts
```

**ID pattern cheat sheet:**

| Pattern | Namespace | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `X\d` | P0 TODO items (hermetic seal breakers) | X1 |
| `E\d` | P1 TODO items (engagement) | E3 |
| `M\d-II` | P2 TODO items (quality) | M2-II |
| `S\d-II` | P3 TODO items (strategic) | S1-II |
| `G\d` | Setup guide TODO items | G2 |
| `#\d+` or bare 1–17 | Omega criteria | #8 |
| `H\d` | Horizons | H3 |
| `AP-\d` | Anti-patterns | AP-1 |
| `W\d-II`, `SP\d-II`, `BS\d-II`, `LC\d-II`, `BL\d-II`, `ET\d-II`, `LO\d-II` | E2G-II findings | W1-II |
| Two-digit `\d\d` or sprint name | Sprints | 29 / AUTOMATA |

## Cross-Reference: Omega ← TODO

Which TODO items advance which omega criteria. Items with no omega link are quality/maintenance work.

| Omega | Criterion | TODO Items |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| #1 | Soak test passes | E2, S1-II |
| #2 | Stranger test ≥80% | M1-II |
| #3 | Engagement baseline | E2 |
| #4 | Runbooks validated | M1-II |
| #5 | ≥1 application submitted | X1, X3, E3 |
| #6 | AI-conductor essay published | E4, E5 (MET via earlier deploy) |
| #7 | ≥3 external feedback | X1, X3, X4 (feeds) |
| #8 | ≥1 product live | X2 |
| #9 | revenue_status: live | M2-II |
| #10 | MRR ≥ operating costs | M2-II |
| #11 | ≥2 salons/events | S2-II |

**Unlinked TODO items** (quality/infrastructure, no direct omega advancement): M4-II (seed.yaml), M5-II (monitoring), M6-II (CI restructure), S4-II (essays backlog), S5-II (second product investigation), G1 (LinkedIn token), G2 (Render hosting), G3 (Ghost newsletter).

*This concordance was generated on 2026-02-17. It should be updated when TODO items are completed, new IDs are created, or omega criteria change status. The `scripts/invoke.py` CLI tool parses this file directly — keep the markdown table format consistent.*
