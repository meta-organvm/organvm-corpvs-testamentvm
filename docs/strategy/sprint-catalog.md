# Sprint Catalog — Every Possible Sprint Beyond the 16

**Created:** 2026-02-16
**Author:** @4444j99 (AI-conductor model: human directs, AI generates, human reviews)
**Status:** REFERENCE — This document is a static inventory, not a living roadmap
**Companions:** [`there+back-again.md`](./there+back-again.md) (omega roadmap), [`operational-cadence.md`](../operations/operational-cadence.md) (daily/weekly rhythm)
**Constitution:** [`docs/memory/constitution.md`](../memory/constitution.md) — Articles I-VI govern all specifications

---

> *This catalog names everything that could be done. The operational cadence governs when — and whether — to do it. This is a menu; AP-1 says don't order everything at once.*

---

## How to Read This Document

This document is an **exhaustive inventory** of every sprint-worthy work package that could be executed across the eight-organ system. It is organized into 18 categories covering all 8 organs, all 5 horizons, and all 17 omega criteria.

**This document is NOT:**
- A backlog (there is no priority ordering within categories)
- A roadmap (see [`there+back-again.md`](./there+back-again.md) for that)
- A commitment (listing something here does not mean it will be done)
- A sprint plan (see [`operational-cadence.md`](../operations/operational-cadence.md) AP-1)

**This document IS:**
- A complete map of addressable work
- A reference for weekly planning sessions (operational cadence Part I, Friday retrospective)
- Evidence that the system's scope is understood and bounded
- A menu from which individual tasks are pulled into the weekly rhythm
- One leg of a governance triangle: roadmap (destination) + cadence (rhythm) + catalog (menu)

### Conventions

- **Sprint numbers** continue from the 16 construction sprints (01-IGNITION through 16-PLATINUM), starting at 17. Sprint specs for all 26 completed sprints live in `docs/specs/sprints/` with continuous numbering (01–26, no gaps). Sprints 17–26 are now complete (REMEDIUM, SYNCHRONIUM, CONCORDIA, TRIPARTITUM, SUBMISSIO, METRICUM, PUBLICATIO, CANON, INSPECTIO, PROPAGATIO). These numbers are for reference only — the operational cadence discourages named sprints in favor of weekly rhythm.
- **Catalog vs. execution numbering (17–23):** This catalog was written as a hypothetical inventory. When sprints 19–23 were actually executed, some took different names than what the catalog had assigned. The canonical sprint numbers and names are in `docs/specs/sprints/` — those are what actually happened. Catalog items that were displaced (never executed at their catalog number) are marked as unscheduled future work below. For sprints ≥24, catalog numbers are hypothetical references until executed.
- **Effort estimates** assume AI-conductor model (AI generates, human reviews). They are order-of-magnitude only.
- **Horizon mapping** uses H1–H5 from [`there+back-again.md`](./there+back-again.md):
  - **H1** — Prove It Works (Days 1–30)
  - **H2** — Validate Externally (Days 15–90)
  - **H3** — Generate Revenue (Days 30–180)
  - **H4** — Build Community (Days 60–365)
  - **H5** — Achieve Recognition (Days 90–730)
- **Omega criteria** are numbered #1–#17 per the omega roadmap's "Seventeen Omega Criteria" table.

## CATEGORY 1: INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR

*Fix what's broken before building anything new.*

### Sprint 17: REMEDIUM (Remedy) — RESOLVED

**Fix failing orchestration workflows.** *(Resolved 2026-02-16: All workflows confirmed healthy.)*

Investigation revealed no actual failures:
- `essay-monitor` and `publish-process`: **Phantom failures** — push events triggering schedule-only workflows; latest real scheduled runs succeeded
- `ci.yml` (Python CI): **Already replaced** by Minimal CI; all 31 Minimal CI runs pass
- `validate-dependencies`: **Already fixed** — back-edges removed in CONVERGENCE; latest run passed
- `distribute-content`: 29/29 SKIPPED is **correct behavior** — waiting for `ready-to-distribute` label

No workflow code changes were needed. The "failing" signal was misleading — caused by push triggers on schedule-only workflows, which produce expected failures in GitHub's run history.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Effort | ~1 hour (diagnosis only) |
| Horizon | H1 (Prove It Works) |
| Omega criteria | #1, #17 |
| Resolution | Diagnosed as phantom failures; no code changes required |

### Sprint 18: SYNCHRONIUM (Sync) — COMPLETE

**Clone all missing repos locally and sync workspace.** *(Completed 2026-02-16 as part of workspace restructure.)*

All 97 repos cloned to flat `~/Workspace/<org>/<repo>/` layout. 14 missing repos cloned, 8 `.github` org profiles cloned, public-process synced, 68 repos moved from legacy ~/world/ hierarchy, 39 symlinks removed, git remotes converted SSH→HTTPS. 29 GB freed.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Effort | ~2 hours |
| Horizon | H1 (operational completeness) |
| Omega criteria | #17 (full local workspace) |
| Resolution | All repos cloned and workspace restructured to flat 2-level layout |

### Sprint 19: CONCORDIA (Registry Reconciliation) — COMPLETE

**Reconcile registry with actual GitHub state.** *(Executed as Sprint 19, 2026-02-16.)*

Registry reconciliation: 6 orphan repos registered (91→97), render-second-amendment deleted locally (14 GB freed), 2 LFS checkout failures fixed, seed.yaml audit (38/86 = 44% coverage).

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Effort | ~2 hours |
| Horizon | H1 (registry integrity) |
| Omega criteria | Constitution Article I (registry is never wrong) |
| Resolution | Registry reconciled with GitHub — 97 entries, all verified |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Effort | ~1.5 hours |
| Horizon | H1 (data integrity) |
| Omega criteria | Constitution Article I (registry is never wrong) |
| Resolution | All 13 active documents reconciled with registry-v2.json |

| Order | Sprint | Covers Criteria | Calendar Dependency |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~**17 REMEDIUM**~~ | ~~#1, #17~~ | **COMPLETE** — workflows confirmed healthy |
| ~~2~~ | ~~**41/21 SUBMISSIO**~~ | ~~#5, #7~~ | **COMPLETE** — prep executed as Sprint 21; human submissions pending |
| 3 | **42 PEREGRINUS** | #2, #4, #16 | Validates H1 claims |
| 4 | **27 BETA-VITAE** | #8 | Selected by Sprint 25 INSPECTIO assessment — life-my--midst--in is the recommended beta product |
| 5 | **40 MERCATURA** | #9, #10 | Requires a beta product |
| 6 | **64 VIGILIA** | #1, #3, #17 | 30 calendar days (passive) |
| 7 | **24 DISTRIBUTIO** | #13 | Creates inbound surface area |
| 8 | **45 CONVIVIUM** | #11 (partial) | First salon |
| 9 | **46 CONVIVIUM-II** | #11 (complete) | Second salon |

| 11 | **52 RENOVATIO** | #15 | Quick portfolio update |
| 12 | **43 PETITIO** | #14 | Grant application for recognition |

**Already met:** #6 (AI-conductor essay published 2026-02-11), #1/#17 prerequisites (REMEDIUM — workflows healthy), #5/#7 prerequisites (SUBMISSIO — prep complete, human submissions pending)

**Remaining critical path:** 10 sprints (42→27→40→64→24→45→46→47→52→43)

**Note on critical path vs. cadence:** The critical path identifies the minimum set. The operational cadence (`operational-cadence.md`) determines how these are sequenced into weekly rhythm. They are pulled from this catalog as individual tasks, not executed as named sprints — per AP-1.
