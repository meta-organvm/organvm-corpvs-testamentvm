## Questions? FAQ

**Q: Can I do this solo or do I need a team?**
A: Solo is fine (~4.4M TE across 2 sprints with 4 parallel generation streams). With team, assign repos by organ + parallelize.

**Q: What if I get stuck on a particular README?**  
A: Use template (Document 03) + checklist (Document 04). If still stuck, move to next repo + return later.

**Q: Do all READMEs really need to be 3,000+ words?**  
A: No. Minimums: ORGAN-I (3,000), ORGAN-II (2,500), ORGAN-III (2,000), others (1,500+). Quality over quantity.

**Q: What if I discover a repo shouldn't be public?**  
A: Move to private + update registry. Don't delay; fix immediately.

**Q: Can I start Phase 2 with Phase 1 incomplete?**  
A: No. Phase 2 depends on all 60 repos documented. Complete Phase 1 first.

**Q: What if I miss the Feb 23 deadline?**  
A: No problem. Extend to Mar 2 (1 week slip). Better late + complete than rushed + incomplete.
