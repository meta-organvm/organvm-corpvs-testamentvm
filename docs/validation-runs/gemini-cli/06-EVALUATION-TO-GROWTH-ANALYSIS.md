# Evaluation-to-Growth Analysis: Seven-Organ Planning Corpus

**Date:** 2026-02-09 (post-TE-conversion revision)
**Scope:** All 20+ documents in `~/Workspace/organvm-pactvm/ingesting-organ-document-structure/`
**Framework:** Evaluation --> Reinforcement --> Risk Analysis --> Growth

---

## Post-Conversion Status Summary

On Feb 9, 2026, the planning corpus underwent a systematic conversion from human-hour estimates to TE (Tokens-Expended) budgets. Four parallel AI agents executed ~278 edits across 15 active documents in a single session. This was the first real stress test of the AI-conductor model the corpus describes.

| Workstream | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| TE conversion (hours --> tokens) | DONE | 278 edits across 15 files |
| Org architecture (Phase -1) | DONE | `organvm.env`, `organvm.config.json`, `organvm.env.local` created |
| Budget reconciliation | DONE | All docs reconciled to `02` sums (~4.4M TE Phase 1); ~500K gap closed |
| Org rename/creation on GitHub | NOT STARTED | Human must rename 3 orgs + create 4 new via web UI |
| Phase 0 corpus refinement | NOT STARTED | Blocked on org rename |
| Phase 1 README writing | NOT STARTED | Blocked on Phase 0 |

**Scorecard:**

| Dimension | Pre-Conversion | Post-Conversion | Delta |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Measurement unit | Hours (fictional) | TE (grounded in token arithmetic) | Major improvement |
| Budget coherence | Self-contradictory | Internally consistent within documents | Improved |
| Cross-document agreement | Mixed | 15/15 files use TE; budget totals still diverge | Partially improved |
| Org naming | Hardcoded, cryptic | Env-var templated, self-describing | Major improvement |
| Registry accuracy | Aspirational | Aspirational (unchanged) | No change |
| Execution progress | Zero | Phase -1 complete, config files created | Incremental |

## PHASE 1: EVALUATION

### 1A. CRITIQUE -- Contradictions, Fallacies, Gaps

#### C1: The Phantom 16 Repos

**Severity: CRITICAL | Status: STILL OPEN**

The registry claims 60 repos. The registry contains 44. This 16-repo gap is never acknowledged or reconciled. Every document that says "60 repos" is inflated by ~27%.

- `registry-v2.json` line 9: `"total_repos": 60`
- Actual count: 44 repos across 7 organs
- `summary.local_repos_to_migrate`: 14, but none are enumerated with real names
- `02-REPO-INVENTORY-AUDIT.md` lists repos 45-58 as `[local-theory-1]`, `[local-art-2]`, etc. -- placeholders, not real repos

**Implication:** The entire effort estimation, timeline, and validation plan is built on a repo count that includes 16 placeholders with no real names. The "comprehensive README for all 60 repos" promise is impossible to fulfill because 16 of those repos do not exist yet. The `02` inventory header says "74 Repositories" while the body shows 44 registered + 14 local = 58. Even the document that should resolve the count contradicts itself.

**Resolution path:** Phase 0 must reconcile: audit the 8 unregistered repos discovered in `organvm-i-theoria`, classify the 14 local repos with real names, and update `registry-v2.json` to reflect actual state.

#### C2: TE Budget Variance

**Severity: HIGH | Status: COMPLETELY REWRITTEN (post-TE-conversion)**

The TE conversion resolved the old "hours don't add up" critique. Hours are gone. But the conversion revealed a new problem: the planning documents disagree about Phase 1 totals.

**The numbers:**

| Source Document | Phase 1 TE Budget |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `00-c-MASTER-SUMMARY.md` (Effort Allocation table) | ~4.4M TE (reconciled) |
| `02-REPO-INVENTORY-AUDIT.md` (per-repo sum) | ~4.4M TE (authoritative) |
| `IMPLEMENTATION-PACKAGE-v2.md` | ~4.4M TE (reconciled) |
| `there+back-again.md` | ~4.4M TE (reconciled) |

The authoritative per-repo sums from `02` total ~4,420K TE:

| Organ | TE Budget (from 02) |
|-------|---------------------|
| ORGAN-I (Theory) | ~850K TE |
| ORGAN-II (Art) | ~1,110K TE |
| ORGAN-III (Commerce) | ~1,080K TE |
| ORGAN-IV (Orchestration) | ~210K TE |
| ORGAN-V (Public) | ~90K TE |
| ORGAN-VI (Community) | ~120K TE |
| ORGAN-VII (Marketing) | ~170K TE |
| Local repos (14) | ~790K TE |
| **Phase 1 Total** | **~4,420K TE** |

Meanwhile, `00-c` budgets ~3.9M TE for Phase 1 (the Effort Allocation breakdown shows ORGAN-I at ~660K vs `02`'s ~850K, ORGAN-II at ~850K vs `02`'s ~1,110K, and so on). The gap is ~500K TE, or roughly 13%.

**Root cause:** The `00-c` Effort Allocation was written first as a top-down estimate. The `02` inventory was written second, bottom-up, by summing individual repo budgets. The bottom-up count is higher because it captured the actual complexity per repo -- POPULATE tasks at ~110-180K TE, REWRITE tasks at ~72-110K TE -- that the top-down estimate smoothed over.

**The real constraint is not tokens but human review:** At ~15 minutes of focused human review per repo, 44 repos require ~11 hours of concentrated reading. Adding the 14 local repos brings it to ~14.5 hours. This is the actual bottleneck. The AI generation side (even at 4.4M TE) runs in parallel across 4 streams and completes in hours. The human review is serial and spans days.

#### C3: "Parallel Launch" vs. "Sequential Dependencies"

**Severity: MEDIUM | Status: STILL OPEN**

The corpus simultaneously claims:
1. "All 7 organs launch simultaneously" (`orchestration-system-v2.md`)
2. "Start ORGAN-II only after ORGAN-I templates finalized" (`05-RISK-MAP.md`)
3. "Do ORGAN-IV last (incorporates findings from others)" (`05-RISK-MAP.md`)
4. "ORGAN-V essays will reference all other organs" (`05-RISK-MAP.md`)

The *launch* is simultaneous but the *work* is sequential. This distinction is never made explicit. The risk: if ORGAN-II documentation slips, ORGAN-V essays cannot reference it, ORGAN-IV registry cannot validate it, and the "all 7 operational" gate fails.

The `there+back-again.md` execution plan partially addresses this by assigning organs to parallel AI streams (Stream A: I+IV, Stream B: II+V+VI, Stream C: III+VII), but the cross-stream dependencies remain unmanaged. Stream B cannot finalize ORGAN-V essays until Stream A's ORGAN-I READMEs exist, because the essays reference theory repos.

#### C4: Governance for an Army of One

**Severity: MEDIUM | Status: STILL OPEN**

The governance model specifies:
- Monthly audits across 40+ validation points (`orchestration-system-v2.md`)
- Peer review of all 44+ READMEs (`04-PER-ORGAN-VALIDATION-CHECKLISTS.md`)
- Promotion proposals requiring 3+ documented use cases (`orchestration-system-v2.md`)
- POSSE distribution to Mastodon, LinkedIn, Discord (`public-process-map-v2.md`)
- Community facilitation (ORGAN-VI)

All of this is designed for a team. The operator is one person. The risk map (`05`) identifies "Peer Review Bottleneck" as a risk, then mitigates it with "self-review using Document 04 checklist" -- which defeats the entire purpose of peer review. The TE conversion actually worsened this: the governance overhead is now expressed in concrete token costs (~135K TE/month for audits, ~50K TE per promotion proposal), making the unsustainability quantifiable rather than vague.

#### C5: Registry Schema Is Underpowered for Its Claims

**Severity: MEDIUM | Status: STILL OPEN**

`registry-v2.json` calls itself "single source of truth" but lacks:
- No `dependencies` field between repos (the dependency graph exists only in prose)
- No `promotion_status` field (the state machine LOCAL-->CANDIDATE-->...-->ARCHIVED exists only in docs)
- `documentation_status` is a free-text string ("README REQUIRED") with no enum
- No `last_validated` timestamp
- No `health_check_url` or `ci_status` field
- Missing: the fields that `github-actions-spec.md` workflows need to consume

The registry cannot serve as the backbone for the automation layer described in `github-actions-spec.md`. The env-var architecture from Phase -1 (`organvm.config.json`) is well-designed but the registry has not been updated to use it.

#### C6: Grant/Hiring Timeline Mismatch

**Severity: LOW | Status: STILL OPEN**

`IMPLEMENTATION-PACKAGE-v2.md` positions the system for 2026 funding opportunities. But:
- Knight Foundation cycles typically require 6-12 months lead time
- NSF Convergence Accelerator has specific solicitation windows
- AI hiring processes at Anthropic/OpenAI take 2-6 months
- The system targets Feb 17 launch; applications would go out in March; earliest decisions June+

The urgency framing ("Why Now?") is motivational, not strategic. The actual funding landscape does not compress to a single sprint. The TE conversion did not change this -- it made the execution plan more concrete but the external timeline remains misaligned.

#### C7: TE Conversion Gap -- Systematic Optimism in Original Estimates

**Severity: HIGH | Status: NEW (discovered during conversion)**

The TE conversion revealed a pattern: original estimates were systematically low by ~13%. This is not a random error but a structural one.

**Evidence:**
- Phase 1 planned at ~3.9M TE (`00-c`, `IMPLEMENTATION-PACKAGE-v2.md`)
- Phase 1 actual per-repo sum: ~4.4M TE (`02-REPO-INVENTORY-AUDIT.md`)
- Gap: ~500K TE (~13% underestimate)

**Pattern:** The top-down estimates in `00-c` consistently undercount compared to `02`'s bottom-up sums. ORGAN-I: ~660K planned vs ~850K actual. ORGAN-II: ~850K planned vs ~1,110K actual. The gap is largest for organs with POPULATE tasks (creating content from scratch), which cost ~110-180K TE per repo -- significantly more than the ~72K TE assumed for typical rewrites.

**Implication:** If Phase 1 is 13% underestimated, Phases 2 and 3 likely carry similar optimism. Applying the same correction:
- Phase 2: ~1.0M TE planned --> likely ~1.13M TE
- Phase 3: ~1.1M TE planned --> likely ~1.24M TE
- Grand total: ~6.5M TE (from `02` sums) vs ~6.0M TE (from `00-c` framing)

This is the corpus planning optimistically about itself -- a common failure mode in solo projects without external validation.

---

### 1B. LOGIC CHECK -- Structural Reasoning

#### L1: Dependency Direction Claimed =/= Dependency Direction Real

**Status: STILL OPEN**

The corpus asserts: "No back-edges. ORGAN-III cannot depend on ORGAN-II output" (`orchestration-system-v2.md`).

But ORGAN-III repos like `classroom-rpg-aetheria` and `gamified-coach-interface` are interactive products that *implement* ORGAN-II creative work for commercial purposes. The dependency is not cleanly I-->II-->III (theory-->art-->commerce); it is often I-->III or even III-->II (a commercial product drives artistic development). The unidirectional model is an idealization that simplifies governance at the cost of accuracy.

#### L2: "Documentation Precedes Deployment" Is Backwards

**Status: STILL OPEN**

The plan says: write comprehensive READMEs first, validate second, deploy third. But:
- You cannot write accurate installation instructions for code you have not validated
- You cannot document metrics that do not exist yet
- You cannot write case studies for products without real usage data
- You cannot cross-reference other repos' READMEs that have not been written yet

The natural order is: validate what exists --> document what is real --> fill gaps with new work. The TE conversion does not change this logical inversion -- it just prices the inverted workflow more accurately.

#### L3: The "100%" Completion Claim

**Status: STILL OPEN**

`registry-v2.json` declares every organ at `"completion": "100%"` and `"launch_status": "OPERATIONAL"` -- but this is the *target state* written as *current state*. The registry is aspirational, not descriptive. Any tooling that reads it will get false positives. The `02` inventory shows average scores of 40-65/100 across organs, directly contradicting the registry's 100% claims.

---

### 1C. LOGOS -- Rational Appeal Assessment

**Post-conversion status: STRENGTHENED**

The TE conversion and Phase -1 work meaningfully improved the rational foundation:

**Strengths (reinforced):**
- The env-var-first templatable architecture (`organvm.env`, `organvm.config.json`) is genuinely production-quality -- the strongest logos element in the corpus
- TE arithmetic replaces fictional hour estimates with grounded token math (1 token ~ 4 characters ~ 0.75 words; generation + revision overhead per repo = 50-180K TE)
- The seven-organ taxonomy remains intellectually coherent
- The registry-as-source-of-truth concept is sound, even if the implementation is incomplete

**Weaknesses (reduced but present):**
- Arguments for "meta-system as portfolio asset" still rely on analogy (Holly Herndon, Zach Lieberman) without evidence that *this specific system* would be evaluated similarly
- The rational case for parallel launch over sequential remains thin
- Budget variance (3.9M vs 4.4M) undermines claims of precision even as the methodology itself is sound
- Cover letter templates still reference "60+ repos" -- factually incorrect

**Net assessment:** The TE conversion moved logos from "aspirational" to "grounded with known gaps." The env-var architecture is the single strongest rational artifact.

---

### 1D. PATHOS -- Emotional Resonance

**Post-conversion status: WEAKENED**

The TE conversion made the corpus more rigorous but also more bureaucratic. Where the original had vague hour estimates that at least read like human effort, the replacement has token budgets that read like API billing.

**What works:** The vision of an artist-engineer building a complete creative infrastructure remains compelling. The Greek naming adds gravitas. The ambition is inspiring.

**What does not work:** The corpus now oscillates between grandiose vision and exhausting numerics. A grant reviewer encountering "~88K TE (REWRITE)" next to "~135K TE (POPULATE)" will see process optimization, not artistic practice. The validation checklists, scoring rubrics, workflow YAML, and now TE budgets create cumulative bureaucratic weight that buries the artistic vision under infrastructure.

**What is missing:** The human story deficit deepened. The conversion added ~278 data points (TE values) while adding zero narrative content. Why does this person build autonomous creative systems? What artistic questions drive the work? What personal stakes are involved? The corpus remains all architecture, no soul. An ORGAN-V essay about the builder's motivation would do more for portfolio impact than all the TE arithmetic combined.

---

### 1E. ETHOS -- Credibility Assessment

**Post-conversion status: MIXED**

**What improved:**
- The old critique "hour estimates don't withstand arithmetic scrutiny" is retired. TE values are grounded in token math with documented assumptions.
- The config architecture (`organvm.env`) is production-quality and demonstrates real engineering practice
- Self-awareness about risks (document 05) shows maturity
- Systematic thinking is evident throughout -- now backed by quantitative methodology

**What worsened:**
- TE arithmetic is validated, but the ~13% gap between planned and actual reveals optimistic planning. This is a credibility issue: the system that claims to be precise is still 13% off.
- Claiming 60 repos when 44 exist (unchanged)
- Declaring 100% completion when average scores are 40-65/100 (unchanged)
- Governance designed for a team when it is a solo operation (unchanged)
- No evidence of prior successful project completions at this scale (unchanged)

**Net assessment:** The "hours don't add up" credibility gap is closed. A new gap opened: "the system is more precise but still optimistic." This is a smaller credibility issue but a real one.

---

## PHASE 2: REINFORCEMENT -- What Works

### R1: The Org Architecture Is Sound

The Phase -1 work (naming, env vars, config files) is genuinely excellent:
- `organvm.env` with `${ORGAN_PREFIX}` templating is fork-friendly
- Greek ontological naming is distinctive and internally consistent
- Separating template (`organvm.env`) from instance (`organvm.env.local`) is best practice
- `organvm.config.json` bridges bash and JSON ecosystems cleanly

**Verdict: KEEP. This is the strongest output of the corpus.**

### R2: The Seven-Organ Taxonomy Is Defensible

Theory / Art / Commerce / Orchestration / Public / Community / Marketing maps well to real creative-institutional practice. The separation of concerns is clean. The taxonomy could genuinely serve as a reusable framework for other creative practitioners.

**Verdict: KEEP. The model itself is the portfolio piece.**

### R3: The Scoring Rubric (01) Is Practical

The 0-100 scoring system in `01-README-AUDIT-FRAMEWORK.md` is well-designed:
- 4 categories (Existence, Content, Accuracy, Portfolio) with clear point allocations
- Score bands with actionable interpretations
- Organ-specific definitions add precision

**Verdict: KEEP but reduce scope. Apply the full rubric to the top 10-15 repos, not all 44.**

### R4: Risk Identification Is Honest

Document `05` correctly identifies the real risks: overwhelming scope, broken code examples, strategic decision paralysis, peer review bottleneck. The *identification* is good even when the *mitigations* are weak (e.g., "self-review" as a mitigation for missing peer reviewers).

**Verdict: KEEP the risk awareness. REWRITE the mitigations to account for solo operation.**

### R5: The Registry Concept Is Right

Having a machine-readable single source of truth for all repos is the correct architectural choice. The current implementation needs schema enrichment (dependencies, promotion status, honest completion), but the concept is sound and the config infrastructure (`organvm.config.json`) is ready to support it.

**Verdict: KEEP the concept. REBUILD the schema.**

### R6: The TE Conversion Demonstrates AI-Conductor Model Working

The TE conversion itself is evidence that the AI-conductor workflow works at scale:
- **Scope:** 278 edits across 15 active documents
- **Execution model:** 4 parallel AI agents working simultaneously
- **Duration:** Single session (not days or weeks)
- **Quality:** Consistent formatting, no regressions in non-TE content, all files syntactically valid
- **Human role:** Direction, review, reconciliation -- exactly as the model predicts

This is the first empirical proof point for the AI-conductor model described throughout the corpus. Before this, it was theory. Now there is a concrete instance: a corpus-wide transformation that would have taken a human editor many hours was completed by coordinated AI agents in a fraction of the time.

**Verdict: DOCUMENT THIS. It is the strongest portfolio evidence the project has produced so far.**

---

## PHASE 3: RISK ANALYSIS

### 3A. BLIND SPOTS

#### B1: No Minimum Viable Launch Defined

The corpus has exactly two modes: "all 7 organs at 100%" or "not launched." There is no MVL (Minimum Viable Launch) that answers: "If we can only do X, what is the smallest credible system?"

A credible MVL might be:
- 3 organs (I, II, III) with 5 flagship repos each = 15 repos fully documented
- ORGAN-IV registry covering those 15 + stubs for the rest
- 1 ORGAN-V essay explaining the system
- Total: ~20 repos documented vs 44+, at roughly ~2M TE vs ~4.4M TE

#### B2: No Content Triage

All repos are treated with equal weight. `the-invisible-ledger` (20/100 score, "GOVERNANCE ONLY", ~50K TE) gets a README template alongside `classroom-rpg-aetheria` (70/100, flagship product, ~95K TE). There is no mechanism to say "this repo gets a 200-word stub and this one gets a 3000-word showcase." The `02` inventory assigns TE budgets per repo, which is a step toward triage, but the templates (`03`) and checklists (`04`) still apply uniformly.

#### B3: No Existing Audience

ORGAN-V (Public Process) and ORGAN-VII (Marketing) assume distribution channels that do not exist. There is no mention of current follower counts, email list size, or community members. Building distribution infrastructure for an audience of zero is premature optimization. The TE budgets for ORGAN-VII (~170K TE) represent investment in channels with no proven reach.

#### B4: No Rollback Plan

If launch day arrives and 3 organs are incomplete, what happens? The corpus says "delay launch until all 7 ready" but provides no alternative timeline, no partial-launch option, no "good enough" criteria. The Bronze/Silver/Gold tiering in E1 below would resolve this, but it does not exist in any current document.

#### B5: The "AI Parallel Streams" Risk

`there+back-again.md` proposes 4 parallel AI streams (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Copilot). This assumes all 4 tools can produce consistent, high-quality technical READMEs with correct cross-references, working code examples, and portfolio-appropriate language -- simultaneously, without coordination overhead.

The TE conversion provided early evidence: 4 agents working in parallel *did* produce consistent output for a well-defined task (search-replace with formatting rules). But README writing is a different beast -- it requires understanding of each repo's purpose, codebase, and positioning. The risk is not that parallel streams fail entirely, but that they produce inconsistent tone, incompatible cross-references, or hallucinated content that requires expensive human reconciliation.

#### B6: No Technical Debt Inventory

The repos presumably contain code. The plan is entirely about documentation. But what if the code does not work? What if dependencies are outdated? What if there are security vulnerabilities? The plan assumes all code is functional and only documentation is missing. No evidence supports this assumption. The `02` inventory scores repos on documentation quality, not code health.

#### B7: Coordination Overhead Between Parallel AI Streams

The TE conversion demonstrated a specific coordination risk: 4 parallel agents produced output that required a reconciliation pass. The top-down budget (~3.9M TE from `00-c`) and the bottom-up budget (~4.4M TE from `02`) diverged by ~13% because agents worked from different base assumptions about per-repo effort.

This pattern will recur during README writing:
- Stream A (ORGAN-I) may establish cross-reference conventions that Stream B (ORGAN-II) does not follow
- Stream C (ORGAN-III) may use different portfolio language than Streams A and B
- Code example formatting, link structures, and section ordering may diverge across streams
- The human must reconcile these divergences -- and that reconciliation cost is not budgeted

**Estimated overhead:** 5-10% of total TE for cross-stream reconciliation, or ~220-440K TE. This is a hidden cost that would push the real Phase 1 budget toward ~4.6-4.8M TE.

---

### 3B. SHATTER POINTS

#### S1: The Binary Launch Gate

"If any organ is incomplete at launch day, delay launch until all 7 ready." (`orchestration-system-v2.md`)

This is the single highest-risk design decision. With 44 repos across 7 organs, the probability that all pass all validation checks simultaneously approaches zero. This gate virtually guarantees indefinite delay.

**Shatter scenario:** ORGAN-II has 4 empty repos (score 0/100). Even after archiving 3, the remaining portfolio infrastructure (showcase, archive, case studies) needs real content -- past works, methodology writeups, artistic statements -- that may not exist in documented form. This blocks ORGAN-II, which blocks launch, which blocks everything.

#### S2: Cross-Reference Deadlock

READMEs must cross-reference each other: ORGAN-I links to ORGAN-II implementations, ORGAN-II links back to ORGAN-I theory, ORGAN-III links to both. But if I-->II-->III READMEs are being written simultaneously by different AI streams, the cross-references point to documents that do not exist yet. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem that the sequential schedule (`05-RISK-MAP`) partially addresses but the "parallel launch" framing obscures.

The TE conversion did not address this -- it priced the READMEs but not the cross-reference resolution pass. A dedicated link-validation sweep would add ~100-200K TE to Phase 1.

#### S3: Registry Becomes Stale Immediately

If `registry-v2.json` claims 100% completion and operational status before launch, then post-launch reality (repos at 50-70% quality, some validation checks failing) makes the registry a liability, not an asset. Any evaluator who reads the registry and then visits the actual repos will see the gap. The TE conversion made this worse by adding precise-looking TE budgets to a registry that still contains aspirational state.

#### S4: Governance Overhead Collapses the System

If the solo operator actually follows the governance model:
- Monthly audit of 40+ checks across 7 organs: ~135K TE/month
- Promotion proposals with 3+ use cases per repo: ~50K TE each
- POSSE distribution per essay: ~24K TE each
- Registry updates after every change: ~12K TE each

Ongoing maintenance exceeds ~300K TE/month in generation cost, plus ~8-10 hours/month of human review time. For a solo operation, this is unsustainable. The governance model will be abandoned within 2-3 months of launch.

---

## PHASE 4: GROWTH -- Bloom + Evolve

### 4A. BLOOM -- What Wants to Emerge

**The planning corpus itself is the most impressive artifact.** 20+ documents with internally consistent taxonomy, config architecture, governance models, and strategic positioning -- built and refined through AI-conductor collaboration. This demonstrates exactly the "architectural reasoning" and "systems thinking" the author wants to showcase. The irony: the meta-documentation about the system is more portfolio-ready than the system it describes.

**The framework is more valuable than the instance.** The env-var-first templatable architecture, the seven-organ taxonomy, the scoring rubric, the validation checklists, the TE budgeting methodology -- these are reusable tools. "organvm" as a forkable framework for creative practitioners to organize their work is a more compelling product than one person's 44 documented repos.

**The TE conversion process is the best portfolio evidence so far.** 278 edits across 15 files by 4 coordinated AI agents in a single session is a concrete demonstration of the AI-conductor model. An essay describing this process -- the methodology, the coordination challenges, the reconciliation gaps, the lessons learned -- would be more compelling to AI hiring managers than any number of perfectly formatted READMEs.

**The honest narrative is more compelling than the polished one.** An essay titled "I Tried to Launch 44 Repos at Once: What I Learned About Scope, Governance, and AI-Assisted Documentation" is more interesting to evaluators than "Here Is My Perfect 7-Organ System."

### 4B. EVOLVE -- Concrete Transformations

#### E1: Define MVL (Minimum Viable Launch)

Replace the binary "all or nothing" gate with tiers:

| Tier | Scope | TE Estimate | What It Proves |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Bronze** | 5 flagship repos fully documented + registry covering all 44 | ~1.5M TE | "I can write exceptional documentation" |
| **Silver** | 15 repos (top 5 per organ I/II/III) + ORGAN-IV registry + 1 essay | ~3M TE | "I can orchestrate a multi-organ system" |
| **Gold** | All 44 registered repos documented + 3 essays + working workflows | ~6.5M TE | "I built a complete creative infrastructure" |

**Launch Bronze first. Iterate to Silver. Gold is a 3-6 month goal, not a single sprint.**

#### E2: Fix the Registry

Rebuild `registry-v2.json` with:
- Honest `documentation_status` enum: `["none", "stub", "draft", "complete", "validated"]`
- Honest `completion` reflecting actual state (not 100% when average is 50/100)
- `dependencies` array per repo (enables the automation layer from `github-actions-spec.md`)
- `promotion_status` enum matching the state machine: `["LOCAL", "CANDIDATE", "PUBLIC_PROCESS", "GRADUATED", "ARCHIVED"]`
- Remove `"launch_status": "OPERATIONAL"` -- replace with actual status
- Add `"tier"` field: `["flagship", "standard", "stub", "archived"]`
- Integrate with `organvm.config.json` for org resolution

#### E3: Triage Repos Into Tiers

Not all 44 repos deserve equal effort. Use the `02` TE budgets as a starting signal:

| Tier | Count | Treatment | TE Range |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Flagship** (5-7 repos) | The ones you would show in an interview | 3000+ word README, working demos, case study | ~95-180K TE each |
| **Standard** (15-20 repos) | Solid but not portfolio-critical | 1000-word README, basic examples | ~50-88K TE each |
| **Stub** (10-15 repos) | Exists, has code, but not showcase material | 200-word README, status note | ~12-24K TE each |
| **Archived** (5-8 repos) | Empty, skeleton, or superseded | Archive notice only | ~12K TE each |

#### E4: Simplify Governance to Solo-Scale

Replace the team-scale governance with:
- **Quarterly** review (not monthly): ~50K TE self-audit, update registry
- **No formal promotion process**: Move repos when ready, update registry
- **No POSSE automation initially**: Manually post when you publish an essay
- **No peer review requirement**: Self-review with the checklist is appropriate for solo; supplement with AI validation passes

Estimated ongoing maintenance: ~100K TE/quarter + ~4 hours/quarter of human review. This is sustainable. The current model (~300K TE/month) is not.

#### E5: Reframe the Narrative

The portfolio pitch should lead with:
1. **The framework** (organvm as a forkable system for creative practitioners)
2. **The process** (AI-conductor model: 278 edits by 4 agents, TE budgeting, corpus-scale coordination)
3. **The implementation** (your 44 repos organized within the framework)
4. **The documentation** (essays about building and governing creative infrastructure)

Not: "I have 60 repos across 7 perfectly orchestrated organs."

#### E6: Revised Timeline with Reconciled TE Values

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable | TE Budget |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Phase -1** | DONE | Org architecture, config files, name migration | ~150K TE |
| **Phase 0** | 1 sprint | Fix registry schema, triage repos, define MVL, rename/create orgs | ~200K TE |
| **Phase 1a** | 2 sprints | Bronze tier: 5-7 flagship READMEs | ~1.5M TE |
| **Phase 1b** | 2 sprints | Silver tier: 15 standard READMEs + 1 essay | ~3.0M TE |
| **Phase 2** | 2 sprints | Validate Bronze+Silver, fix broken code, update registry | ~1.1M TE |
| **Phase 3** | Ongoing | Gold tier work, additional essays, workflow automation | ~1.2M TE |
| **Total** | | | **~7.2M TE** |

Note: the ~7.2M TE total exceeds the original ~6.0M TE estimate by ~20%. This reflects the reconciled `02` numbers (~4.4M for Phase 1 vs ~3.9M) plus the ~13% correction applied to Phases 2-3, plus coordination overhead (B7). **Bronze launch: ~3 sprints. Silver launch: ~5 sprints. Gold: 3-6 months.**

#### E7: Meta-Lesson -- The Conversion Process Proves the Model

The TE conversion was the first real test of the AI-conductor model at corpus scale. Key findings:

1. **Parallel AI agents work for well-defined transformations.** Search-replace with formatting rules across 15 files is an ideal task: clear scope, mechanical execution, verifiable output.
2. **Coordination overhead is real and unbudgeted.** The 4 agents produced divergent budget totals (3.9M vs 4.4M) because they worked from different source documents with different base assumptions.
3. **Human reconciliation is the actual bottleneck.** The agents finished quickly. Identifying the budget mismatch, tracing its origin across documents, and deciding which number is authoritative -- this took human judgment.
4. **The process itself is portfolio-worthy.** A writeup of "How 4 AI Agents Edited 278 Values Across 15 Documents (And What Went Wrong)" is more compelling evidence of AI-systems expertise than any README.

This meta-lesson should inform Phase 1 README writing: plan for reconciliation passes, budget coordination overhead, and treat the process documentation as a first-class deliverable.

## SYNTHESIS: Top Actions

| Priority | Action | Status | TE Cost |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Complete Phase -1** -- human renames 3 orgs + creates 4 on GitHub | BLOCKED on human | ~30 min human |
| 2 | **Fix the registry** -- honest status fields, actual repo count (44 not 60), real completion %, tiered classification | NOT STARTED | ~88K TE |
| 3 | **Define 5-7 flagship repos** -- these get the full 3000-word treatment; everything else gets proportional effort | NOT STARTED | ~24K TE |
| 4 | **Kill the binary launch gate** -- replace with Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers | NOT STARTED | ~12K TE |
| 5 | **Reconcile budget variance** -- align `00-c` totals with `02` per-repo sums; adopt ~4.4M TE as Phase 1 baseline | DONE | ~24K TE |
| 6 | **Write the process essay** -- "How I Used 4 AI Agents to Edit 278 Values: Lessons in AI-Conductor Workflow" | NOT STARTED | ~120K TE |
| 7 | **Simplify governance** -- quarterly solo review, no POSSE automation at launch, no promotion ceremony | NOT STARTED | ~24K TE |

**What is done:** Phase -1 org architecture, config files, TE conversion, budget reconciliation (~500K gap closed across 11 files). These are real outputs.
**What remains:** Everything that touches actual repos, actual code, and actual audiences.

*This analysis uses the Evaluation-to-Growth (E-->G) framework: identify what is broken (Critique), verify what is sound (Reinforce), map what could fail (Risk), and propose what should change (Growth). The TE conversion provided the first empirical data point for the AI-conductor model. The work ahead is execution -- not more planning.*
