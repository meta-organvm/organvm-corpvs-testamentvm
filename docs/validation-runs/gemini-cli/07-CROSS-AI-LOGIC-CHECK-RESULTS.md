# 07: CROSS-AI LOGIC CHECK RESULTS

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Input:** 3 Prompts (Codex, Gemini, Copilot) against 20+ Planning Documents
**Synthesizer:** Conductor (Human/AI Loop)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The cross-AI logic check rigorously stress-tested the planning corpus. The results confirm the **technical feasibility** of the architecture but unanimously reject the **sequential execution plan** and the **binary launch gate**.

**The Verdict:** The "Seven-Organ" model is sound. The "All-at-Once" execution is not.

### Consensus Findings (All 3 Models Agree)
1.  **Registry Schema is Blocking:** The current `registry-v2.json` cannot support the specified GitHub Actions. It is missing critical fields (`dependencies`, `promotion_status`). **Action: Rebuild schema immediately.**
2.  **Binary Launch is Critical Risk:** Waiting for 44 repos to be 100% ready guarantees indefinite delay. **Action: Adopt Bronze (5 Flagships) / Silver (15 Repos) / Gold (Full System) tiers.**
3.  **Coordination Overhead is Real:** The ~5-10% overhead for managing parallel AI streams (discovered in TE conversion) is accurate and must be budgeted. **Action: Add 10% "Coordination Tax" to all future estimates.**
4.  **Org Architecture is Solid:** The `organvm.env` -> `organvm.config.json` pattern is production-grade. **Action: Keep as-is.**

### Key Disagreements & Resolutions

| Topic | Codex (Tech) | Gemini (Strategy) | Copilot (Execution) | **RESOLUTION** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Launch Order** | Parallelize automation (`validate-dependencies` first) | Launch ORGAN-V first (build audience) | Write Flagships first (regardless of organ) | **Hybrid: Fix Registry -> Launch ORGAN-V -> Write 5 Flagships.** |
| **Registry Source** | Generated artifact (build output) | Manual file (submit for jobs) | Prerequisite for writing | **Manual file for Phase 1 (speed), automate in Phase 3.** |
| **Portfolio Asset** | Automation workflows | Narrative (essays) | Working code (Flagships) | **Lead with Narrative (Why), prove with Code (What), sustain with Automation (How).** |

## DETAILED FINDINGS

### 1. Technical Feasibility (Codex)
*   **Pass:** Env-var architecture, GitHub Actions logic (mostly), Budget totals.
*   **Fail:** Registry schema (missing fields), API rate limits (monthly audit), Secret management (7 orgs).
*   **Critical Add:** `validate-dependencies` is the most valuable workflow. Implement it first.

### 2. Strategic Reasoning (Gemini)
*   **Pass:** Meta-system as differentiator, Framework as reusable asset.
*   **Fail:** "All-or-nothing" positioning, relying on "slow money" (Knight/NSF) without "fast money" (residencies).
*   **Critical Pivot:** Don't just document the system; **document the process of building the system.** The "TE Conversion" essay is a more powerful portfolio piece than any README because it proves AI operational mastery.

### 3. Execution Feasibility (Copilot)
*   **Pass:** TE estimates for tiers (Bronze/Silver), risk identification.
*   **Fail:** Uniform templates (Flagships need more, Stubs need less), checking code validity (READMEs for broken code are lies).
*   **Critical Fix:** **Triage Repos.** Don't write 44 READMEs. Write 5 great ones (Flagships), 15 good ones (Silver), and 24 stubs.

## ACTION PLAN: The "Bronze" Sprint

Based on this synthesis, the immediate plan (`there+back-again.md`) requires the following adjustments:

1.  **Phase 0 (Technical Foundation):**
    *   **Fix `registry-v2.json`**: Add `tier` (Flagship/Standard/Stub), `dependencies`, `promotion_status`.
    *   **Prune Inventory**: Archive the 4 empty ORGAN-II repos immediately.
    *   **Secret Strategy**: Define how secrets (`ORCHESTRATION_PAT`) are distributed to 7 orgs.

2.  **Phase 1 (Narrative & Flagships):**
    *   **Write Essay 1**: "How I Used 4 AI Agents to Edit 278 Values" (The TE Conversion Process).
    *   **Write 5 Flagship READMEs**:
        1.  `orchestration-start-here` (ORGAN-IV)
        2.  `public-process` (ORGAN-V)
        3.  `auto-revision-epistemic-engine` (ORGAN-I)
        4.  `core-engine` (ORGAN-II)
        5.  `classroom-rpg-aetheria` (ORGAN-III)

3.  **Phase 2 (Automation):**
    *   Deploy `validate-dependencies` to the 5 Flagships.
    *   Verify the graph.

**Goal:** A "Bronze" system (5 repos + 1 essay + working registry) is better than a broken "Gold" system.

## REVISED METRICS

*   **Phase 1 Budget:** ~1.5M TE (Bronze) + 10% Overhead.
*   **Timeline:** 2 Sprints (1 for Registry/Essay, 1 for Flagships).
*   **Success State:** 5 Perfect Repos > 44 Mediocre Repos.

*This report supersedes previous risk assessments in `05` and `06`.*
