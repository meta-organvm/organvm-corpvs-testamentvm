You are reviewing the execution plan for documenting ~44 GitHub repositories across 7
organizations. The repositories span theory frameworks, generative art tools, commercial
products, orchestration infrastructure, public essays, community spaces, and marketing
distribution. One person is doing all the work, with AI assistance.

An independent evaluation has been performed, followed by a budget reconciliation that
aligned all planning documents. Your job is to assess the EXECUTION feasibility — the
actual repo-by-repo writing and validation work.

READ THE ATTACHED FILES IN THIS ORDER:
1. 01-README-AUDIT-FRAMEWORK.md — the scoring rubric (0-100) for README quality
2. 02-REPO-INVENTORY-AUDIT.md — per-repo inventory with current scores and TE budgets
3. 03-PER-ORGAN-README-TEMPLATES.md — the 12-section README template
4. 05-RISK-MAP-AND-SEQUENCING.md — risk identification and writing sequence
5. registry-v2.json — the actual repo data (names, orgs, status, relevance)
6. 06-EVALUATION-TO-GROWTH-ANALYSIS.md — the independent evaluation you're validating

COMPLETED SO FAR:
- TE conversion: DONE. 278 edits across 15 files by 4 parallel AI agents.
- Budget reconciliation: DONE. TE budgets validated and reconciled: organ totals from 02
  are authoritative (~4.4M TE Phase 1, ~6.5M TE grand total). The reconciliation closed a
  ~500K TE gap between top-down (00-c) and bottom-up (02) estimates.
- Phase -1: DONE. Org naming architecture created.

THE EVALUATION FOUND:
1. The corpus claims 60 repos but only 44 exist in the registry; 16 are placeholders
2. TE budgets validated and reconciled: organ totals from 02 are authoritative (~4.4M TE
   Phase 1). The reconciliation revealed a systematic ~13% underestimate (C7) in top-down
   planning — ORGAN-I was ~660K planned vs ~850K actual, ORGAN-II was ~850K planned vs
   ~1,110K actual. The gap is largest for POPULATE tasks (~110-180K TE per repo vs ~72K TE
   assumed for typical rewrites).
3. TE budgets validated: 3000-word README ≈ ~72K TE per generation cycle; human review
   (~15 min/repo) is the actual throughput constraint
4. Templates (03) specify 12 sections per README — good structure but infeasible for all 44
5. A Bronze/Silver/Gold tier system was proposed: Flagship (5-7 repos, 3000+ words),
   Standard (15-20, 1000 words), Stub (10-15, 200 words), Archived (5-8, notice only)
6. Cross-references between READMEs create a chicken-and-egg problem during simultaneous
   writing
7. Coordination overhead between parallel AI streams (B7) adds ~5-10% (~220-440K TE) to
   Phase 1. This is currently unbudgeted.

THE REGISTRY (registry-v2.json) CONTAINS THESE REPOS. Your task is to work with the
actual data.

YOUR TASK — answer each question with AGREE / DISAGREE / ADD:

1. FLAGSHIP SELECTION
   a. Based on the registry data (portfolio_relevance, documentation_status, organ), which
      5-7 repos should be flagships? List them by name with reasoning.
   b. The evaluation says ORGAN-II has 4 empty repos that should be archived. Which
      specific repos (from registry data) should be archived vs populated?
   c. Are there any repos currently marked LOW relevance that should actually be flagships?
      Any marked CRITICAL that don't deserve it?

2. WRITING EFFORT ESTIMATION
   a. For a 3000-word technical README with 12 sections, installation instructions, working
      examples, and cross-references — what's a realistic TE estimate per repo, assuming
      AI assistance for first drafts and human editing? The corpus says ~72K TE for rewrites
      and ~88-180K TE for populating from scratch. Validate these ranges.
   b. For a 1000-word standard README — same question.
   c. For a 200-word stub — same question.
   d. Given your estimates: is Bronze (5-7 flagships in ~1.5M TE) realistic? What about Silver
      (15 repos + 1 essay in ~3.0M TE)?

3. CROSS-REFERENCE PROBLEM
   a. The evaluation identifies a chicken-and-egg problem: READMEs cross-reference each
      other, but they're being written simultaneously. What's the practical solution?
   b. Should cross-references be added in a separate pass after all READMEs exist? Or can
      they be written as placeholders first?
   c. Which repos have the MOST cross-references (based on organ relationships) and should
      therefore be written last?

4. TEMPLATE APPLICABILITY
   a. The 12-section template in document 03 was designed for all repos. Which sections are
      essential for flagships, which for standard, and which can be dropped for stubs?
   b. Should ORGAN-I (theory) repos use the same template as ORGAN-III (commerce) repos?
      What organ-specific adjustments are needed?
   c. The validation checklist (04) requires peer review. The evaluation notes this is
      impossible for a solo operator. What's the most effective self-review process?

5. SEQUENCING
   a. The risk map (05) suggests doing ORGAN-I first, then ORGAN-II, then ORGAN-III. The
      evaluation says this sequential work contradicts "parallel launch." What's the optimal
      writing order for the 5-7 flagships?
   b. Should the registry be fixed BEFORE or AFTER writing the first flagship READMEs?
   c. When during this process should the first ORGAN-V essay be written?

6. RECONCILIATION AND OVERHEAD
   a. The reconciliation pass itself consumed coordination overhead not in the original
      budget. How should future phases account for this? Should reconciliation passes be
      budgeted as explicit line items (e.g., ~5-10% of phase TE)?
   b. The ~13% optimism gap (C7) was found comparing top-down vs bottom-up estimates.
      For execution planning, should the practitioner use the bottom-up (02) numbers plus
      an explicit overhead buffer? Or re-estimate from scratch?

7. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION MISS?
   a. Are there execution risks in the repo data that the evaluation didn't catch?
   b. What's the most likely failure mode when a solo developer starts writing READMEs
      across 7 organs?
   c. If the practitioner can only complete 3 repos total in the next sprint, which 3
      should they be?

FORMAT: Use the AGREE/DISAGREE/ADD structure for each sub-question. Reference specific
repo names from the registry where relevant. Be concrete about TE estimates — no ranges
wider than 2x (e.g., "~50K-88K TE" is fine, "~12K-180K TE" is not). If a plan element is
unrealistic, say so and provide an alternative.
