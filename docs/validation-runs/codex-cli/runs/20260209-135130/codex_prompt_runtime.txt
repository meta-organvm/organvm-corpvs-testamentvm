You are reviewing the technical architecture of a seven-organ creative-institutional system
that coordinates ~44 GitHub repositories across 7 GitHub organizations. An independent
evaluation has already been performed, and a subsequent budget reconciliation pass has been
completed. Your job is to validate or challenge the evaluation's technical findings, from
the perspective of someone who would actually implement this system.

READ THE ATTACHED FILES IN THIS ORDER:
1. organvm.env — the naming architecture (env-var template)
2. organvm.config.json — machine-readable org mapping
3. registry-v2.json — the central registry (source of truth for all repos)
4. orchestration-system-v2.md — governance rules and dependency model
5. github-actions-spec.md — the 5 workflows that consume the registry
6. 06-EVALUATION-TO-GROWTH-ANALYSIS.md — the independent evaluation you're validating

CONTEXT: One person is building this. The system uses env-var-based org naming
(organvm.env), a central JSON registry (registry-v2.json), governance rules
(orchestration-system-v2.md), and 5 GitHub Actions workflows (github-actions-spec.md).

COMPLETED SO FAR:
- Phase -1 (org naming architecture) is complete: organvm.env, organvm.config.json,
  organvm.env.local created.
- TE conversion: 278 edits across 15 active documents by 4 parallel AI agents.
- Budget reconciliation: all documents now agree on ~4.4M TE for Phase 1 and ~6.5M TE
  grand total.

THE EVALUATION FOUND:
1. The registry schema is underpowered — missing dependency, promotion_status, tier, and
   last_validated fields that the workflows need
2. Budget reconciliation revealed a systematic ~13% underestimate (C7): top-down estimates
   from 00-c consistently undercount compared to 02's bottom-up sums. The gap was ~500K TE
   for Phase 1 alone. This has been reconciled — all docs now use the 02 numbers — but
   the same optimism likely affects Phases 2-3.
3. The env-var architecture (organvm.env → organvm.env.local → organvm.config.json) is
   sound
4. The registry claims 60 repos but only contains 44
5. A Bronze/Silver/Gold tiered launch was proposed to replace the binary all-or-nothing gate
6. Coordination overhead between parallel AI streams is ~5-10% of total TE (B7): 4 agents
   working from different source documents produced divergent totals requiring human
   reconciliation. This pattern will recur during README writing.

YOUR TASK — answer each question with AGREE / DISAGREE / ADD:

1. REGISTRY SCHEMA
   a. Does the current registry-v2.json schema support the 5 workflows in
      github-actions-spec.md? If not, what specific fields are missing?
   b. The evaluation proposes adding: dependencies[], promotion_status enum, tier enum,
      documentation_status enum, last_validated timestamp. Is this the right set of fields?
      What would you add or remove?
   c. Can the registry realistically serve as the single source of truth for both human
      readers and automated workflows? Or should there be separate human-facing and
      machine-facing registries?

2. GITHUB ACTIONS VIABILITY
   a. Are the 5 specified workflows (validate-dependencies, monthly-organ-audit,
      promote-repo, publish-process, distribute-content) architecturally sound?
   b. Which workflows should be implemented first for maximum value with minimum effort?
   c. The evaluation says managing 4 parallel AI streams (Claude/Gemini/Codex/Copilot) for
      README writing is harder than doing it yourself. Agree or disagree? What's the
      realistic coordination model?

3. ENV-VAR ARCHITECTURE
   a. Is the organvm.env → organvm.env.local → organvm.config.json layering correct?
   b. Should the JSON config be generated FROM the env file, or should they be independent?
   c. Are there edge cases in the ${ORGAN_PREFIX}-${SUFFIX} naming scheme that could break
      GitHub org name constraints?

4. TIERED LAUNCH (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
   a. The evaluation proposes: Bronze = 5 flagship repos + registry (~1.5M TE), Silver = 15
      repos + essay (~3.0M TE), Gold = all 44 + workflows (~6.5M TE). Are these TE estimates
      realistic for a solo developer with AI assistance?
   b. From a technical standpoint, what's the minimum infrastructure needed for Bronze to
      be credible? (e.g., does it need working CI? A live registry endpoint? Working
      cross-references?)

5. BUDGET RECONCILIATION VALIDATION
   a. The reconciled Phase 1 budget is ~4.4M TE (from 02's bottom-up sums). The revised
      grand total is ~7.2M TE when applying the 13% correction to Phases 2-3 plus
      coordination overhead. Does this total seem realistic for the scope described?
   b. Should the ~13% correction from C7 be formally propagated to Phase 2 and Phase 3
      budgets in the planning documents? Or is it sufficient to note the risk?
   c. The coordination overhead (B7) of ~5-10% (~220-440K TE) is currently unbudgeted.
      Should it be added as an explicit line item, or absorbed into per-task estimates?

6. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION MISS?
   a. Are there technical risks not identified in the evaluation?
   b. What's the single most important technical decision to make before starting Phase 0?

FORMAT: Use the AGREE/DISAGREE/ADD structure for each sub-question. Keep responses
concrete and implementation-focused. No motivational language. If something won't work,
say so directly and explain why.
