# Cross-AI Validation Synthesis (Codex/Gemini/Copilot)

**Run ID:** `20260209-135130`  
**Date (UTC):** 2026-02-09T19:13:04Z  
**Inputs:** Prompt definitions from `07-CROSS-AI-LOGIC-CHECK-PROMPTS.md` and referenced source docs  

## Consensus

1. **Tiered launch is mandatory.**
All three outputs reject all-or-nothing launch behavior and support Bronze/Silver/Gold staging.

2. **Coordination overhead is real and should be budgeted explicitly.**
All three runs endorse explicit overhead budgeting (~5-10%) instead of silently absorbing coordination cost.

3. **Template strategy must be tiered/adaptive.**
Universal full-depth README treatment is not practical for all 44 repos.

4. **Registry quality directly determines execution quality.**
Each output ties automation reliability to stronger structured registry data and governance consistency.

## Disagreements / Tension Points

1. **Narrative-first vs infrastructure-first sequencing.**
- Codex emphasizes schema+automation reliability first.
- Gemini emphasizes strategic narrative framing early (including public essay positioning).
- Copilot emphasizes execution throughput and flagship repo ordering.

2. **How aggressive to propagate corrected totals.**
- Codex strongly supports formal propagation and explicit sensitivity framing.
- Gemini focuses less on numeric propagation and more on positioning quality.
- Copilot is primarily execution-budget practical and keeps bottom-up + buffer framing.

## Additions Introduced by This Run

1. **Machine-first registry + generated human view** (Codex): keep JSON strict, generate human-facing md.
2. **"Simulating organizational scale in solo practice" framing** (Gemini): strategic reframing of perceived over-architecture.
3. **Copilot execution gating details** (Copilot): concrete flagship ordering and archive-vs-populate split for ORGAN-II placeholders.

## Meta-Findings (C7 / R6 / B7)

1. **C7 optimism correction remains directionally validated.**
Responses continue to treat unbuffered planning as optimistic and recommend explicit buffers/line items.

2. **R6 AI-conductor proof remains valid.**
The process-evidence argument is reinforced, especially in Gemini output.

3. **B7 overhead is reinforced across all three runs.**
No output argues for ignoring coordination overhead.

## Action Conflicts Requiring Human Choice

1. **First deliverable emphasis:** schema+automation first vs narrative essay first.
2. **Flagship selection breadth:** strict 5 vs expanded 7 in early Bronze pass.
3. **Registry migration strategy:** immediate full schema migration vs staged field rollout.

## Recommended Resolution Path

1. Lock minimal schema additions required for dependency and promotion validity.
2. Produce Bronze artifact set (5-7 flagships + registry coherence checks).
3. Publish one process narrative anchored in concrete Bronze outputs.
4. Apply explicit overhead/buffer policy to all subsequent phase estimates.
