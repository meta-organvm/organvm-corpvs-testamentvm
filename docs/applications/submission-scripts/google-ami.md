## Artist Statement

**~300 words — copy between the lines:**

---

Production-grade AI orchestration with creative-artistic applications.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories. I don't produce individual artworks. I produce the *systems* that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work — and the visible record of how those systems are built is itself the primary creative output.

The process of creation is the product. The 42 essays I've published aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time. The governance rules — registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines — aren't bureaucratic overhead; they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

I work in the tradition of solo producers who became orchestras: Brian Eno treating the studio as a compositional instrument, Trent Reznor building entire albums alone because nobody else would commit at the necessary intensity. I use AI tools the way these practitioners used their technologies — as instruments for realizing an architectural vision, not as replacements for creative judgment.

The eight-organ system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, (c) an argument that the process of creation — made visible and governable — is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce, and (d) a reusable model other practitioners can learn from.

## Project Description / Why This Opportunity

---

The eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance: 82+ CI/CD workflows, 31 dependency edges with zero violations, a formal promotion state machine, and 2,349+ automated tests across the flagship frameworks (agentic-titan: 1,095 tests, recursive-engine: 1,254 tests). Built using the AI-conductor methodology — AI generates volume, human directs architecture.

Google Artists + Machine Intelligence Grants represents a critical opportunity to sustain and extend this practice. The work is built, documented, and operational — what it needs now is the time and resources to deepen, not to start over.

## Key Differentiators (if asked "what makes you different")

1. AI-augmented creative practice, not AI-generated art — AI serves as compositional instrument; the vision is human.
2. Solo production at institutional scale — one person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations.
3. Governance as creative medium — registry design, dependency graphs, and promotion pipelines are generative structures.
4. Radical transparency at system scale — ~410K+ of documentation, 33 sprint specs, 12 ADRs, a constitution.
