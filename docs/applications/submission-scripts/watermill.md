### Governance as Performance: Conducting a Living System

**Proposed by:** [YOUR NAME]
**Discipline:** Interdisciplinary — Systems Art / Performance / Digital Infrastructure
**Duration:** July 5 – August 2, 2026

#### The Proposal

I propose to develop *Governance as Performance* — a series of installations and performance works that make the invisible architecture of creative systems visible, audible, and participatory.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating 100 software repositories across 8 organizations through formal governance rules — dependency graphs, promotion state machines, automated validation workflows. I've built this system over 5+ years, producing 42 published essays and 404,000+ words of documentation along the way. The governance model — the rules that decide how work flows between theory, art, commerce, and community — is itself the primary artistic output.

At Watermill, I want to translate this invisible architecture into collaborative performance.

#### Three Proposed Works

**1. The Conductor's Score (Installation)**
A real-time visualization of the eight-organ system's dependency graph projected onto a wall-sized surface. Each of the 100 repositories appears as a node; the 31 validated dependency edges glow as data flows between them. The system's actual GitHub activity — commits, issues, workflow runs — drives the visualization in real time. Visitors can trigger events (opening issues, requesting promotions) that ripple through the graph. The installation makes governance *visible* — the audience sees an institutional structure operating as a living organism.

**2. The Orchestration (Collaborative Performance)**
A structured improvisation for 6-12 performers, using the eight-organ system's governance rules as a performance score. Each performer represents one organ (Theory, Art, Commerce, Governance, Public Process, Community, Marketing, Meta). The dependency rules become movement rules: ORGAN-I (Theory) can pass material to ORGAN-II (Art), but ORGAN-II cannot pass material back. The no-back-edges constraint that governs the software system becomes a choreographic constraint that shapes what movements, sounds, and gestures can flow between performers. Robert Wilson's formal compositional methodology — treating time, space, and structure as equal elements — is the natural context for this work.

**3. The Public Process (Documentation-as-Performance)**
Daily documentation of the residency itself, written and published in real time as new entries in the ongoing essay series. The act of documenting becomes part of the residency's performative output — not a reflection on the experience but an extension of it. These essays will be published to the 42-essay public archive, making the Watermill experience part of the system's permanent record. The audience for these texts extends beyond Watermill to the growing readership of the public process series.

#### Why Watermill

Robert Wilson treats performance as architecture — time, space, light, and structure composed with the same rigor as a building. My practice treats software architecture as performance — governance rules, data flows, and coordination protocols composed with the same intention as a score. The Watermill Center's commitment to experimental, collaborative, interdisciplinary work is the ideal context for translating digital governance into embodied practice.

The collaborative environment — 60-100 artists from 30+ countries — offers something my solo practice specifically lacks: other bodies in the room. The organ system was built by one person using AI as a compositional instrument. Watermill would be the first time the system's governance rules are tested as collaborative performance scores with real performers, not automated agents.

#### About the Artist

MFA in Creative Writing. 11 years teaching at 8+ institutions. Systems artist and creative technologist building at the intersection of governance, generative art, and AI-augmented production. The eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 organizations, 42 published essays, 404,000+ words of public documentation, and 82+ CI/CD pipelines — all built by a single practitioner using AI as a compositional instrument. 5+ year NYC resident. LGBTQ+.

## Artist Statement / Bio (if SlideRoom asks separately)

**~200 words — adjust to field limits:**

Copy everything between the lines:

---

I design environments where creative organisms grow — and then I document the process of growing them.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. I don't produce individual artworks. I produce the systems that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work — and the visible record of how those systems are built is itself the primary creative output.

The governance rules — registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines — aren't bureaucratic overhead; they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge. Every architectural decision is an artistic decision.

I work in the tradition of solo producers who became orchestras: Brian Eno treating the studio as a compositional instrument, Trent Reznor building alone because nobody else would commit at the necessary intensity. I use AI tools the way these practitioners used their technologies — as instruments for realizing an architectural vision, not as replacements for creative judgment.

At Watermill, I want to translate the system's invisible governance into visible, collaborative performance — using the dependency rules as choreographic scores.

## Short Bio (if separate field, ~75 words)

Copy everything between the lines:

---

Systems artist and creative technologist. MFA Creative Writing, 11 years teaching at 8+ NYC institutions. Builds the eight-organ creative-institutional system: 100 repositories across 8 organizations, 42 essays, 404,000+ words — all produced solo using AI as a compositional instrument. The governance model IS the art. Based in NYC. LGBTQ+. Seeking to translate digital governance into collaborative performance at Watermill.

## Work Samples

SlideRoom will ask for media uploads. Prepare the following:

### Sample 1: Portfolio Site with Generative Layer

**URL:** `https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/`

Every page includes a generative p5.js visual layer with CMYK color logic and Jost typography. The site is the artwork — documentation, navigation, and visual generation are inseparable.

### Sample 2: Eight-Organ System Architecture

**URL:** `https://github.com/meta-organvm`

100 repositories across 8 organizations. Machine-readable registry, automated dependency validation, formal promotion state machine, 11 governance workflows. The architecture IS the artwork.

### Sample 3: Public Process Essay Series

**URL:** `https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/`

42 published essays (~134,000 words) documenting construction of the system in real time. Building-in-public as performance.

### Sample 4: Generative Art Framework

**URL:** `https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master`

Where theory becomes art — generative visual and sonic output built with p5.js, SuperCollider, and Pure Data.

**If video sample requested (≤3 min):** Record a screen capture walking through the portfolio site's generative layer, the GitHub organization overview, and the essay index. Narrate briefly. Upload as MP4.

**If images requested:** Screenshot the portfolio site (multiple pages showing different generative compositions), the GitHub meta-org overview page, and the public-process essay list.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **Character/word limits tighter than expected:** Trim "The Orchestration" section from the proposal first. "The Conductor's Score" and "The Public Process" are the strongest pieces.
- **Form asks for discipline/medium:** "Interdisciplinary — Systems Art / Performance / Digital Media"
- **Form asks for specific collaborators:** "Open to collaborating with any discipline. The governance-as-score framework accommodates performers, visual artists, musicians, and dancers."
- **Video required but no time to record:** Submit a PDF proposal with screenshots instead. The written proposal is strong enough standalone.
- **$12 fee is a hardship:** The fee goes to SlideRoom, not Watermill. If financially difficult, email residencies@watermillcenter.org and ask about fee waivers — some programs have them.
- **Website won't load / SlideRoom technical issues:** Contact support@slideroom.com or residencies@watermillcenter.org. Note the deadline is 11:59 PM EST tonight.
