Dear Editors,

The AI-Conductor Model: How one person used Claude to coordinate 100 repos, 33 sprints, and 410K+ words — and what it reveals about AI-augmented creative work.

The essay would explore how the eight-organ system — 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, governed by automated dependency validation and a formal promotion state machine — challenges assumptions about what solo creative practice can achieve when AI tools serve as compositional instruments rather than replacements for creative judgment.

Topic fit: AI, creative technology, LLMs, methodology

I've published 42 essays documenting this methodology (https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/). My MFA is in Creative Writing from Florida Atlantic University, and I've taught writing at 8+ institutions over 11 years.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss scope, angle, and timing.

Best,
[Name]
