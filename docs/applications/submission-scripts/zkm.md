## Artist Statement

**~300 words — copy between the lines:**

---

I build creative systems — the governance IS the artwork.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories. I don't produce individual artworks. I produce the *systems* that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work — and the visible record of how those systems are built is itself the primary creative output.

The process of creation is the product. The 42 essays I've published aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time. The governance rules — registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines — aren't bureaucratic overhead; they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

I work in the tradition of solo producers who became orchestras: Brian Eno treating the studio as a compositional instrument, Trent Reznor building entire albums alone because nobody else would commit at the necessary intensity. I use AI tools the way these practitioners used their technologies — as instruments for realizing an architectural vision, not as replacements for creative judgment.

The eight-organ system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, (c) an argument that the process of creation — made visible and governable — is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce, and (d) a reusable model other practitioners can learn from.

## Project Description / Why This Opportunity

---

The eight-organ system is a living creative work — 100 repositories across 8 organizations coordinated through automated governance, a formal promotion state machine, and 42 published essays documenting the process in real time. The governance structures aren't bureaucracy — they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

A residency at ZKM Rauschenberg Residencies would provide the focused time and creative community to advance the most challenging next phase of this work — moving from documented infrastructure to active community engagement and public presentation.

## Work Samples (ordered for this audience)

## Key Differentiators (if asked "what makes you different")

1. Governance as creative medium — registry design, dependency graphs, and promotion pipelines are generative structures.
2. Process-as-product methodology — the 42 essays aren't marketing; they ARE the creative work.
3. Solo production at institutional scale — one person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations.
4. Cross-domain integration — the eight-organ model bridges theory, art, commerce, governance, and community.
