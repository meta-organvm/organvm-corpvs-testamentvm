## Writing Sample

**This is the most important part of the application.** Bread Loaf evaluates based on writing quality first.

### Recommended writing sample:

**Primary:** "The Solo-Auteur Method: AI as Compositional Instrument" (~5,000 words)
- Why: Strong narrative voice, clear argument, personal stake. Demonstrates nonfiction craft at its best.
- Available at: https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/

**Alternate:** "What I've Done Is What I Am" (~2,800 words)
- Why: Confessional-to-analytical essay showing range. More personal, literary nonfiction voice.

**If they want multiple samples (some ask for 2):**
- Use both of the above. They show complementary strengths — one is methodological, one is personal.

### Sample preparation:
- [ ] Copy essay text into a clean document (Word or PDF)
- [ ] Remove any web formatting artifacts
- [ ] Add your name and contact info in the header
- [ ] Check word/page count against their requirements (typically 20-30 pages max)
- [ ] If page limit is tight, use "The Solo-Auteur Method" alone — it's the stronger standalone piece

## Statement of Purpose

**~250-500 words — adjust to their field requirements:**

Copy everything between the lines:

I am applying to the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference nonfiction track because I am at a specific inflection point in my writing practice — the point where volume becomes craft, where documentation becomes literature.

Over the past five years, I have published 42 nonfiction essays totaling over 134,000 words. These essays document the construction of an eight-organ creative-institutional system: 97 software repositories across 8 organizations, built by a single practitioner using AI tools as compositional instruments. The subject matter is technical — governance design, dependency validation, automated workflows — but the essays are not technical writing. They are essays in the Montaigne tradition: attempts to understand what I'm doing by writing about it as I do it.

The writing has gotten better. The early essays are functional — they explain systems, document decisions, justify approaches. The recent essays are something else. "Construction Addiction" examines why I can't stop building. "What I've Done Is What I Am" confronts the gap between self-concept and evidence. "The Solo-Auteur Method" argues that the AI-conductor model is this generation's version of Brian Wilson's studio-as-instrument.

But I am writing in isolation. My MFA (Florida Atlantic University, 2018) gave me foundations in craft, but my current practice — writing about technical systems for a public audience — has no workshop community, no peer readers, no faculty mentors working in similar territory. I am making up this form as I go.

Bread Loaf's nonfiction track offers what I cannot provide for myself: rigorous feedback from writers and editors working at the highest level, a community of practitioners to test these essays against, and the structured time to revise work that has been published but not yet refined into its strongest form. I am not looking for validation. I am looking for the kind of editorial challenge that makes the next 42 essays significantly better than the first 42.

I am an adjunct instructor earning approximately $12,000 per year. I receive SNAP benefits and Medicaid. I cannot afford the conference fee without full scholarship support. A Participant Scholarship covering tuition, room, and board would make attendance possible. I am committed to attending the full 10-day conference and participating fully in workshops, lectures, and community events.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **They ask for a published book:** You do not have a published book. Lead with: "42 published nonfiction essays (~134,000 words) constituting a sustained five-year writing practice." Bread Loaf accepts applicants who have not yet published a book — that's what the conference is for.
- **Writing sample requirements differ from expected:** Adapt. If they want shorter samples (10 pages), use excerpts. If they want unpublished work only, note that many of the 42 essays exist in draft forms with significant revision potential — select a recent draft that hasn't been published yet.
- **Genre confusion — "is this nonfiction?":** Yes. These are essays in the tradition of personal/intellectual nonfiction. The fact that the subject matter involves software systems doesn't change the genre. John McPhee writes nonfiction about geology. You write nonfiction about creative systems.
- **Application fee:** Some conferences charge application fees. If there's a fee and it's a hardship, check for fee waivers or contact the admissions office directly.
- **Travel logistics:** Middlebury, VT is reachable by bus (Greyhound/Peter Pan NYC→Burlington, then shuttle) or Amtrak (NYC→Middlebury via Burlington). Budget $50-100 round trip if scholarship doesn't cover travel.
