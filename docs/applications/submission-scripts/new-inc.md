## Artist Statement

**~150 words — copy between the lines:**

---

Production-grade AI orchestration with creative-artistic applications.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. The 42 published essays documenting this process aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time.

I use AI tools as compositional instruments, the way Brian Eno treated the studio. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work. The result: a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, built over 5+ years and 33 development sprints.

## Project Description / Why This Opportunity

---

The eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance: 82+ CI/CD workflows, 31 dependency edges with zero violations, a formal promotion state machine, and 2,349+ automated tests across the flagship frameworks (agentic-titan: 1,095 tests, recursive-engine: 1,254 tests). Built using the AI-conductor methodology — AI generates volume, human directs architecture.

## Key Differentiators (if asked "what makes you different")

1. AI-augmented creative practice, not AI-generated art — AI serves as compositional instrument; the vision is human.
2. Solo production at institutional scale — one person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations.
3. Governance as creative medium — registry design, dependency graphs, and promotion pipelines are generative structures.
4. Radical transparency at system scale — ~410K+ of documentation, 33 sprint specs, 12 ADRs, a constitution.
