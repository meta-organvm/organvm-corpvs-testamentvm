> NEH Summer Programs for College and University Educators fund seminar-style institutes and workshops for humanities faculty. The application typically requires a short essay connecting your teaching and research to the program's theme. These are credential-building: "NEH Summer Program Participant" on a CV signals humanities credibility. The stipend is secondary.

## Pre-flight (10 minutes)

- [ ] Go to https://www.neh.gov/divisions/education/summer-programs
- [ ] Browse available programs for Summer 2026
- [ ] Select 1-2 programs that align with your teaching and creative practice
- [ ] Confirm the deadline (typically early March for summer programs)
- [ ] Check eligibility: must be a college/university faculty member (adjunct qualifies)
- [ ] Note: NEH uses its own application portal — create an account if needed

### Selecting the Right Program

Look for programs with themes touching:
- **Digital humanities** — your 97-repo system IS digital humanities infrastructure
- **Pedagogy and creative practice** — 11 years teaching writing + creative technology
- **Interdisciplinary approaches** — the eight-organ model spans theory, art, commerce, community
- **AI and the humanities** — the AI-conductor methodology is a humanities contribution

If no program theme is a strong fit, skip this cycle. NEH runs Summer Programs annually.

## Teaching and Research Statement

**~500 words — adjust to program requirements:**

I am an adjunct instructor and creative technologist with 11 years of teaching experience across 8+ institutions, including 100+ courses and 2,000+ students. My teaching spans writing composition, creative technology, digital media production, and interdisciplinary arts.

My current research centers on what I call the "AI-conductor model" — a methodology for human-AI collaboration in which the human practitioner directs AI tools the way a conductor directs an orchestra: setting the structure, making editorial decisions, and ensuring coherence while the AI generates volume. I have applied this methodology to build an eight-organ creative-institutional system: 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community engagement, and marketing — all documented in 404,000+ words of publicly accessible writing.

This work is relevant to [PROGRAM THEME] because [CUSTOMIZE THIS PARAGRAPH TO THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM]. The questions I am investigating — how do formal governance structures shape creative output? how does documentation-as-practice change what gets made? what are the pedagogical implications of AI-augmented creative production? — are fundamentally humanities questions that require humanistic methodologies to answer.

As an educator, I bring these questions directly into the classroom. My courses in writing and creative technology consistently engage students with the relationship between structure and creativity — how constraints (word limits, genre conventions, formal rules) don't limit creative work but generate it. The eight-organ system is a large-scale demonstration of this principle: the governance rules that coordinate 97 repositories are as carefully designed as any artwork the system produces.

Participating in [PROGRAM NAME] would deepen my understanding of [SPECIFIC ASPECT] and directly inform both my teaching practice and my ongoing research into creative systems design. I am particularly interested in [SPECIFIC SEMINAR TOPIC OR FACULTY MEMBER] and how their work connects to the intersection of governance, creativity, and technology that defines my practice.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **Not sure if adjunct qualifies:** NEH defines eligible applicants as "college and university teachers." Adjunct instructors at accredited institutions qualify. If the form asks for "rank" or "title," use "Adjunct Instructor" or "Lecturer."
- **No program theme fits:** Skip this cycle. NEH runs Summer Programs annually. Don't force a bad fit — your time is better spent on higher-fit applications (Creative Capital, WFF Housing, Headlands).
- **Application asks for institutional letterhead:** Ask your most recent employer for a brief letter confirming your teaching role. If that's not possible, provide your teaching history with dates and institutions.
- **Word limits tighter than expected:** Cut the third paragraph first (classroom application). The first two paragraphs carry the essential credential + research narrative.
- **They ask about published research:** The 42 essays and 404K-word corpus IS published research. Frame it as: "42 published nonfiction essays constituting a sustained research program into creative systems design, AI-augmented production, and governance as artistic medium."
