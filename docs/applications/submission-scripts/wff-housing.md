Building creative infrastructure from lived experience of precarity.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories. I don't produce individual artworks. I produce the *systems* that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work — and the visible record of how those systems are built is itself the primary creative output.

The process of creation is the product. The 42 essays I've published aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time. The governance rules — registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines — aren't bureaucratic overhead; they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

I work in the tradition of solo producers who became orchestras: Brian Eno treating the studio as a compositional instrument, Trent Reznor building entire albums alone because nobody else would commit at the necessary intensity. I use AI tools the way these practitioners used their technologies — as instruments for realizing an architectural vision, not as replacements for creative judgment.

The eight-organ system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, (c) an argument that the process of creation — made visible and governable — is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce, and (d) a reusable model other practitioners can learn from.

## Project Description / Why This Opportunity

---

The eight-organ system grows from lived experience of precarity — housing instability, recovery, the specific vulnerability of building a creative practice without institutional support. ORGAN-VI (Community) and ORGAN-V (Public Process) exist because creative infrastructure should be visible, shared, and governed by the people it serves. 42 published essays document this practice transparently, including the failures.

WFF Housing Stability Grant represents a critical opportunity to sustain and extend this practice. The work is built, documented, and operational — what it needs now is the time and resources to deepen, not to start over.

## Key Differentiators (if asked "what makes you different")

1. Cross-domain integration — the eight-organ model bridges theory, art, commerce, governance, and community.
2. Radical transparency at system scale — ~410K+ of documentation, 33 sprint specs, 12 ADRs, a constitution.
3. Process-as-product methodology — the 42 essays aren't marketing; they ARE the creative work.
4. Solo production at institutional scale — one person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations.
