## Artist Statement

**~150 words — copy between the lines:**

---

I build creative systems — the governance IS the artwork.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. The 42 published essays documenting this process aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time.

I use AI tools as compositional instruments, the way Brian Eno treated the studio. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work. The result: a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, built over 5+ years and 33 development sprints.

## Project Description / Why This Opportunity

---

The eight-organ system is a living creative work — 100 repositories across 8 organizations coordinated through automated governance, a formal promotion state machine, and 42 published essays documenting the process in real time. The governance structures aren't bureaucracy — they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

A residency at Eyebeam Speculating on Plurality would provide the focused time and creative community to advance the most challenging next phase of this work — moving from documented infrastructure to active community engagement and public presentation.

## Work Samples (ordered for this audience)

### Sample 1: Public Process Essays

42 essays documenting creative methodology in real time (~142K words)

### Sample 2: Eight-Organ System Hub

**URL:** `https://github.com/meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm`

Governance corpus: 410K+ words, registry, orchestration specs, 33 sprint records

### Sample 3: Portfolio Site

**URL:** `https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/`

Interactive portfolio with generative art (p5.js), CMYK design system, 19 curated projects

### Sample 4: Metasystem Master

**URL:** `https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master`

Generative art meta-system connecting theory to practice

### Sample 5: Recursive Engine

**URL:** `https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria/recursive-engine--generative-entity`

Symbolic operating system: 1,254 tests, 85% coverage, 21 organ handlers, custom DSL

## Key Differentiators (if asked "what makes you different")

1. Governance as creative medium — registry design, dependency graphs, and promotion pipelines are generative structures.
2. Process-as-product methodology — the 42 essays aren't marketing; they ARE the creative work.
3. Solo production at institutional scale — one person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations.
4. Cross-domain integration — the eight-organ model bridges theory, art, commerce, governance, and community.
