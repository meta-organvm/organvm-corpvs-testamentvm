## Benefits Cliff Summary

> **The safety net is an asset, not a constraint to escape.**
> Understanding the cliff mechanics lets you pursue funding without losing essential benefits.

**Current situation:** Single adult, NYC, ~$12K adjunct base, receiving SNAP + Medicaid + Fair Fares.

| Program | Threshold | Grant Treatment | Risk Level |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **SNAP** | $20,352/yr (130% FPL) | **Lump-sum grants EXCLUDED entirely** (BBCE) | **SAFE** |
| **Medicaid** | $21,597/yr (138% FPL) | Taxable grants count toward MAGI | Moderate above ~$9.6K in grants |
| **Essential Plan** | $39,125/yr (250% FPL) | Same as Medicaid, but $0 premium bridge | Low — replaces Medicaid at no cost |
| **Fair Fares** | $22,692/yr (145% FPL) | Counts toward annual income | **Hard cliff** — loss costs ~$700-800/yr |
| **Section 8/NYCHA** | $56,700 (50% AMI) | One-time non-recurring excluded | **SAFE** |

**Safe grant-stacking ceiling:** ~$9K–$12K/year in one-time grants (on $12K adjunct base) preserves ALL benefits. With Schedule C deductions (art supplies, equipment, portfolio hosting), gross ceiling rises to ~$11K–$14K.

**If you exceed Medicaid threshold:** NYS Essential Plan covers you at **$0 premium** up to $39,125/year. The practical health coverage cliff is NOT at $21,597 — it's at $39,125.

**Key rule:** Call **NYLAG (212-613-5000)** before accepting any single grant >$5K. They provide free combined legal + financial counseling for exactly this situation.

## Income Tracks — Beyond Grants

### Consulting ($100–125/hr minimum)

The $60/hr floor from early planning is **significantly below market** (FILE-058). AI orchestration consulting starts at $100–150/hr. Project-based pricing is strategically superior:

| Service | Price Range | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| AI Readiness Audit | $2,500–$5,000 | Entry point, 40-60% convert to paid work |
| AI Integration Sprint | $5,000–$15,000 | Core offering |
| Monthly AI Advisory | $3,000–$7,500 | Retainer model |
| Custom AI System Build | $10,000–$50,000+ | The 103-repo system IS the credential |
| Workshop Facilitation | $500–$2,000/session | Teaching experience as differentiator |
| Documentation Consulting | $2,500–$15,000/project | ~404K+ words proves capacity |

**Benefits cliff note:** Consulting income is earned income (not lump-sum) — counts toward SNAP/Medicaid thresholds. Keep monthly consulting under $1,500 to stay below SNAP earned-income threshold ($23,484/yr). Or accept the Medicaid→Essential Plan transition and earn freely up to $39,125.

### Selective Employment (Only High-Fit Roles)

| Role | Fit | Salary | Status |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| Together AI Lead DX | 6/10 | $160K–$240K | Best employment target — documentation + teaching angle |
| HuggingFace Dev Advocate | 5/10 | $120K–$160K | Skills-based, no years requirement |
| Anthropic FDE | 4/10 | $280K–$400K | Teaching-as-customer-facing — competitive reach |
| OpenAI SE Evals | 4/10 | $230K–$385K | Independent SWE + eval infrastructure |

**Below the line** (apply only if time permits): Cohere (3/10), Runway (3/10), Anthropic SE Claude Code (3/10).

**Benefits cliff note:** Full-time employment income blows through all thresholds. This is a total exit from the benefits safety net — which is fine IF the salary is sufficient ($120K+ provides a wide margin). Do NOT accept a $60K role that loses benefits worth $8K–$15K/yr.

## Writing Income — Premium Publications

A major discovery from research: several publications pay professional rates for exactly the kind of essays already being written. This creates a new income channel that leverages existing output.

| Publication | Rate | Topic Fit | Frequency |
|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Noema Magazine** | $1/word ($3K/3K-word essay) | Technology, governance, AI, culture | Quarterly |
| **MIT Technology Review** | $1-3/word ($2.5K-12K/feature) | AI, creative technology, LLMs | As pitched |
| **Wired** | $2,500+ starting | Technology stories | As pitched |
| **Logic Magazine** | $1,200-2,000/essay | Technology criticism | Themed issues |
| **Aeon** | $500-1,500 | Philosophy, culture, technology | As pitched |
| **Gay & Lesbian Review** | $250/feature | LGBTQ+ culture, arts | Ongoing |
| **e-flux journal** | ~$200-500 | Contemporary art theory | Prestige value |

**Benefits cliff note:** Writing income is **earned income** (not lump-sum) — counts toward SNAP monthly threshold ($1,580/month net for 1 person). One Noema essay per quarter ($3K/quarter = $12K/year) exceeds annual SNAP threshold but keeps within Essential Plan. Two essays per year ($6K) is safest on $12K base.

**Strategy:** Pitch Noema and Logic Magazine this month. Build toward 2-4 premium essay placements per year ($6K-$12K). This supplements grant income without the application overhead.

## Recovery-Informed Staging

From FILE-060 clinical research: cognitive recovery after combined trauma follows a predictable curve.

### Months 1–3: Stabilization (NOW)

- **Focus:** Low-barrier submissions, infrastructure activation, benefits compliance
- **Actions:** GitHub Sponsors, Fractured Atlas, Artadia, NEH, Creative Fellowship
- **Capacity:** Reduced executive function — keep tasks concrete and time-bound
- **Rule:** No new named internal sprints (P0 hermetic seal)

### Months 3–6: Light Production

- **Focus:** Targeted applications, first consulting engagement, portfolio refinement
- **Actions:** Creative Capital, Fire Island, Spencer, Processing Foundation
- **Capacity:** Improving focus — can handle multi-day application processes
- **Rule:** One major submission per week maximum

### Months 6–12: Full Execution

- **Focus:** Career-building residencies, full consulting practice, strategic employment
- **Actions:** Tulsa, NEW INC, Pioneer Works, Queer|Art, conference submissions
- **Capacity:** Professional-quality sustained work
- **Rule:** Reassess benefits cliff position quarterly

---

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any new opportunity:

1. **Fit score ≥ 5/10?** If not, skip unless zero-effort (rolling applications).
2. **Benefits cliff impact?** Check against thresholds above. Lump-sum grants = SNAP safe. Recurring stipends = count as income.
3. **Recovery-stage appropriate?** Don't attempt 6-hour applications during stabilization phase.
4. **Identity position match?** Use the framing that matches the funder (educator / artist / architect / community).
5. **Deadline within capacity?** Only commit to deadlines you can actually meet.
