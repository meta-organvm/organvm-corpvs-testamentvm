## Artist Statement

**~250 words**

Copy everything between the lines:

---

I build creative systems and treat their governance as an artistic medium.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 97 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. Rather than producing individual artworks, I produce the environments in which creative work grows, connects, and sustains itself over time.

The visual dimension of my practice includes generative art built with p5.js (deployed across my portfolio site with CMYK color logic and Jost typography), interactive installations exploring waveform synthesis, and data visualizations that make the system's own governance visible. The 42 published essays documenting this process are as much visual-textual artifacts as they are critical writing — the prose IS the medium.

My reference points are Brian Eno (the studio as compositional instrument), Trent Reznor and Prince (solo production because no one else would commit at the required level), and Brian Wilson (the edit as the creative act). These aren't comparisons of quality — they describe a method: design the environment, generate the material, assemble in the edit. I use AI tools the way Wilson used session musicians. The creative intelligence is in the architecture and the editorial judgment.

The eight-organ system is simultaneously: working infrastructure that produces creative work, a portfolio demonstrating sustained practice at institutional scale, an argument that governance and art are not separate categories, and a reusable model other creative technologists can learn from.

## Work Samples — Descriptions

If Submittable asks for descriptions alongside images/URLs:

### Sample 1: Portfolio Site (Generative Art Layer)

**URL:** `https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/`

Every page of the portfolio site includes a generative p5.js layer — procedural visual compositions using CMYK color logic and Jost typography that respond to the page context. The site itself is the artwork: documentation, navigation, and visual generation are inseparable. The design system (color, type, layout) is as deliberately composed as the content it presents.

### Sample 2: Eight-Organ System Architecture

**URL:** `https://github.com/meta-organvm`

The eight-organ system coordinates 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations through a machine-readable registry, automated dependency validation (no circular dependencies, no back-edges), a formal promotion state machine, and 11 governance workflows. The architecture IS the artwork — the rules governing how theory feeds art, art feeds commerce, and documentation feeds everything are artistic decisions made visible through infrastructure.

### Sample 3: Public Process Essay Series

**URL:** `https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/`

42 published essays (~134,000 words) documenting the construction of the eight-organ system in real time. This is building-in-public as artistic practice — the process of creation treated as a first-class deliverable. Essays cover governance design, solo-auteur methodology, AI-conductor methodology, identity, and system architecture. Published via Jekyll with automated POSSE distribution to Mastodon, Discord, and RSS.

### Sample 4: Metasystem Master (Generative Art Framework)

**URL:** `https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master`

The creative engine of the organ system — a generative art and creative technology framework that synthesizes visual, musical, and interactive outputs. Built with p5.js, SuperCollider, and Pure Data. This is where theory becomes art: the conceptual frameworks from ORGAN-I are translated into generative systems that produce visual and sonic work.

### Sample 5: Agentic Titan (AI Orchestration as Art)

**URL:** `https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis/agentic-titan`

A multi-agent orchestration framework built through 18 development phases with 1,095 tests. This is governance at the code level — agents coordinating through formal protocols, the same way the eight-organ system coordinates repositories. The framework IS the artistic argument: that autonomous systems require the same compositional rigor as any creative work.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **Character/word limits tighter than expected:** Trim the third paragraph of the artist statement first (the reference points paragraph — Eno, Reznor, Prince, Wilson). The first two paragraphs carry the core argument.
- **Form asks for medium/discipline:** "New Media / Digital Art / Systems Art"
- **Form asks for specific project, not practice:** Frame the eight-organ system as a single, ongoing work. Title: "The Eight-Organ Creative-Institutional System."
- **Image uploads required:** Screenshot the portfolio site (generative layer), the GitHub organization page, and the public-process essay index. All are publicly accessible.
- **Resume PDF needed:** Download from `https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/resume/` or use the PDF version if you have one prepared.
