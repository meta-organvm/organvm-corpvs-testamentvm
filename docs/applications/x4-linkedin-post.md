## Post Text (copy and paste)

I built an eight-organ system that coordinates 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations — governing how theory, generative art, commercial products, and community work flow into each other.

After 33 sprints of construction, it's time to break the hermetic seal: the system is live, the documentation is public, and the AI-conductor methodology essay explains how it all works.

The essay: https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/2026/02/11/ai-conductor-methodology/

The system: https://github.com/meta-organvm

Building in public means being public about the parts that don't work, not just the parts that do.
