## Artist Statement

**195 words / ~1,290 characters**

Copy everything between the lines:

---

I build autonomous creative systems and treat their governance as an artistic medium.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories. Rather than producing individual artworks, I produce the systems that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work over time.

This isn't project-based art. It's infrastructure-as-practice: registry design, dependency validation, promotion state machines, automated health checks, and public documentation are all artistic decisions. The choice of how work moves between organs (Theory -> Art -> Commerce) is as important as any individual output.

My reference points include Julian Oliver's critical engineering (treating infrastructure as political/artistic medium), Nicky Case's Explorable Explanations (making systems visible and interactive), and Hundred Rabbits' sustainable tools (building creative infrastructure with radical transparency). Like these practitioners, I believe that protocols, governance structures, and documentation are primary artistic outputs — not supplementary.

The eight-organ system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a portfolio demonstrating systems thinking, (c) an argument that governance and art are not separate categories, and (d) a reusable model that other creative technologists can learn from.

## Project Description

**116 words / ~820 characters**

Copy everything between the lines:

---

The eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations: Theory (ORGAN-I), Art (ORGAN-II), Commerce (ORGAN-III), Governance (ORGAN-IV), Public Process (ORGAN-V), Community (ORGAN-VI), Marketing (ORGAN-VII), and Meta (ORGAN-VIII). Key features: machine-readable registry as single source of truth, automated dependency validation (no circular dependencies, no back-edges), formal promotion state machine, 11 GitHub Actions workflows for autonomous governance, 77+ CI/CD pipelines, and ~404K+ words of public documentation including 42 published essays.

The system operates autonomously: daily health checks, weekly metrics refresh, automated essay distribution via POSSE (Mastodon + Discord + RSS), and a self-generating status dashboard.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **Form has word/character limits:** Artist statement (1,290 chars) and project description (820 chars) are both compact. If limits are tighter, trim the reference points paragraph from the artist statement first.
- **Form asks for different fields:** Use the artist statement for any "about you" or "why this program" field. Use the project description for any "describe your work" field.
- **Form asks for a specific project, not a system:** Lead with the eight-organ system as a single project. If forced to pick one component, use "agentic-titan: a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests."
- **Portfolio site is down:** Use `https://github.com/meta-organvm` as a fallback link to the system hub.
- **Roles still say "Coming soon":** Check back weekly. Set a calendar reminder for March 11 (1 week before deadline). If roles are still not posted by March 14, email creative-fellowship@google.com to confirm the deadline is correct.
