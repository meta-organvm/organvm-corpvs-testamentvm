## Bundle 1: Google Creative Lab Five

**Application URL:** https://www.creativelab5.com/
**Deadline:** Open (no stated close date). 17th class runs July 20, 2026 – July 2, 2027. NYC/London only.
**Materials:** Short answers + portfolio link

### Q1: "What is a 'rule' of creativity you love breaking?"

**"Creativity requires starting from nothing."**

The most interesting creative work I've made came from imposing more constraints, not fewer. My eight-organ system enforces a strict no-back-edges rule: theory feeds art, art feeds commerce — never the reverse. That constraint should limit what's possible. Instead, it forces each organ to be genuinely self-sufficient, which produces work that's stranger and more honest than anything I made when everything could depend on everything else.

The governance model — dependency validation, promotion state machines, automated audits — sounds like the opposite of creative freedom. But designing those rules is where the real creative decisions happen. Choosing *how work flows* between 100 repositories is as much an artistic act as any individual piece the system produces.

I don't break the rule that creativity needs freedom. I break the rule that constraints aren't creative.

### Q2: "What's the best way to gain perspective?"

Build the system that reveals the system.

For five years I worked across theory, generative art, commercial products, and community projects without seeing how they related. The relationships were there — code reused between projects, ideas flowing from research to art to products — but they were invisible. When I formalized those relationships into the eight-organ model with explicit dependency rules and a machine-readable registry, patterns I'd never noticed became obvious. Theory *was* feeding art feeding commerce, but only some of the time, and the failures were as revealing as the successes.

Building in public (ORGAN-V) compounds this. Writing ~404K+ words of documentation forced me to articulate decisions I'd made intuitively. The Aetheria post-mortem — honestly documenting a project that traveled the full Theory→Art→Commerce pipeline and partially failed — taught me more about my practice than any success.

The best way to gain perspective: make the invisible structure explicit, then be honest about what you see.

### Q3: "In 1-3 sentences, tell us about the project you are most proud of and why."

I built an eight-organ system that coordinates 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations — governing how theory, generative art, commercial products, and community work flow into each other through automated dependency validation, a promotion state machine, and ~404K+ words of public documentation. I'm most proud of it because it demonstrates that governance and art aren't separate categories: the rules that coordinate the system are as carefully designed as any artwork it produces. It's infrastructure that makes its own logic visible.

## Bundle 2: Google Creative Fellowship

**Application URL:** https://creativefellowship.google/
**Deadline:** March 18, 2026, 5pm PST (34 days)
**Locations:** NYC, SF, Portland. Program runs June–December 2026.
**Eligibility:** 0-5 years creative experience, US work authorization required.
**Materials:** Portfolio + artist statement + project description

### Artist Statement

I build environments for creative work to grow in.

My reference points are Brian Eno (the studio as compositional instrument), Trent Reznor and Prince (solo production because no one else would commit at the required level), Brian Wilson (the edit as the creative act), and Terrence Malick (the creature formed in the assembly). These aren't comparisons of quality — they describe a method of production I recognize as my own: design the environment, generate the material, assemble in the edit.

I applied to roughly 3,000 jobs before building this system. I lost every time to people who actually wanted those jobs. What I wanted was to build the thing that IS what I am — a documented creative infrastructure that coordinates theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing under a single architecture. The eight-organ system is that infrastructure: 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, governed by automated dependency validation, a formal promotion pipeline, and 42 published essays that treat the process of creation as a first-class deliverable.

This isn't project-based art. It's infrastructure-as-practice. The choice of how work flows between organs — theory feeds art feeds commerce, never the reverse — is as much an artistic decision as any individual output. The governance model isn't bureaucracy; it's generative constraint. The documentation isn't supplementary; it's the product. I use AI tools the way Wilson used session musicians: I direct, I specify, I review, I assemble. The creative intelligence is in the architecture and the editorial judgment, not in any single line of code or prose.

The system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a portfolio demonstrating sustained creative practice at institutional scale, (c) an argument that governance and art are not separate categories, and (d) a methodology — the AI-conductor model — that other practitioners can adopt.

### Project Description

The eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations: Theory (ORGAN-I), Art (ORGAN-II), Commerce (ORGAN-III), Governance (ORGAN-IV), Public Process (ORGAN-V), Community (ORGAN-VI), Marketing (ORGAN-VII), and Meta (ORGAN-VIII). Key features: machine-readable registry as single source of truth, automated dependency validation (no circular dependencies, no back-edges), formal promotion state machine, 5 GitHub Actions workflows for autonomous governance, 82+ CI/CD pipelines, and ~404K+ words of public documentation including 42 published essays. The system was built by a single practitioner using the AI-conductor methodology — AI generates volume, human directs strategy and ensures accuracy — documented transparently in the essay series.

## Bundle 3: Anthropic — Forward Deployed Engineer, Custom Agents

**Application URL:** https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/5074695008
**Deadline:** Rolling
**Salary:** $280,000–$400,000
**Location:** SF or NYC (25% in-office, 25-50% travel)

### Cover Letter

The eight-organ system I built enforces governance rules as data: a machine-readable registry serves as single source of truth for 100 repositories, a dependency validator blocks merges that violate constitutional constraints, and automated audits have maintained 0 critical alerts since launch. That approach — constraints encoded in data, enforced by automation, not by human vigilance — is why I'm drawn to the Forward Deployed Engineer, Custom Agents role at Anthropic.

**Why Anthropic**

Anthropic's approach to AI safety requires constraints that scale — not constraints that erode under pressure. The system described above solves the same problem at infrastructure scale: governance-rules.json encodes constitutional principles, and automated checks enforce them on every merge without human vigilance. The dependency validator blocks violations before they reach production. Monthly audits confirm system health. The constraints hold because they're structural, not procedural.

That's the same discipline Anthropic brings to AI safety: constraints that scale, not constraints that erode under pressure.

**What I'd Bring to the FDE Team**

*Agent development, tested rigorously.* agentic-titan is a multi-agent orchestration framework I built through 18 development phases with 1,095 tests covering agent coordination, message passing, and fault tolerance. a-i-council--coliseum implements multi-agent deliberation — AI agents debating and synthesizing positions — which is exactly the kind of custom agent workflow your enterprise clients need. I understand what it takes to make agent systems reliable in production — phased development, comprehensive testing, clear architectural boundaries.

*Deployment patterns I've already codified.* Your FDE team identifies repeatable deployment patterns and feeds them back to Product and Engineering. I've done this systematically: governance-rules.json encodes rules the system enforces automatically; orchestration-system-v2.md documents the rationale behind every architectural decision; 5 GitHub Actions workflows automate health checks, dependency validation, and promotion across the entire system. These are the kind of artifacts — MCP servers, sub-agents, agent skills — your job description calls for.

*Communication capacity for enterprise environments.* The system includes 404,000+ words of documentation written for grant reviewers and hiring managers, not just developers. I can explain complex orchestration systems to non-technical stakeholders and translate their needs into production implementations.

*Autonomy under ambiguity.* The eight-organ system didn't start with a spec — it started with a question about how to organize 100 repositories into a coherent creative-institutional system. I defined the architecture, built the tooling, documented the decisions, and shipped it. That's the FDE operating model.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how governance-first design applies to deploying Claude in regulated enterprise environments.

## Bundle 4: Anthropic — Software Engineer, Claude Code

**Application URL:** https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4816198008
**Deadline:** Rolling
**Salary:** $320,000–$560,000
**Location:** NYC, SF, or Seattle (25% in-office)

### Cover Letter

I'm applying for the Software Engineer position on the Claude Code team. I build developer tools that make complex systems navigable — and I've been doing it at a scale that tests every architectural assumption.

**Why Claude Code**

I'm excited about AI-assisted coding as a tool to enhance developer productivity because I've experienced firsthand what happens when systems grow beyond what any single person can hold in their head. The eight-organ system I designed coordinates 100 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations. Without strong tooling — a machine-readable registry, automated health checks, dependency validation — that system would be unmanageable. I built those tools because I needed them. Claude Code is building them for everyone.

**What I'd Bring**

*Developer tools shaped by real need.* orchestration-start-here is the entry point to a 100-repo system. It exists because I discovered that without a clear "start here" experience, even well-documented systems are impenetrable. Every design choice — the reading order, the cross-document dependency map, the annotated manifest — came from watching people get lost and building something better. That's the developer experience instinct your team needs.

*LLM orchestration patterns in production.* agentic-titan implements multi-agent orchestration across 18 development phases with 1,095 tests. I've worked with chaining patterns, tool-use, and coordination across agent boundaries. linguistic-atomization-framework breaks language into composable units — the kind of DSL design thinking that matters when building tools that parse and transform code. The eight-organ system itself was built using an AI-conductor workflow model where AI generates volume and human reviews — I've been in the loop of LLM-assisted development for the entire project.

*Full-stack capacity with safety instincts.* The system enforces constitutional constraints: no back-edges in the dependency graph, promotion through a formal state machine, transitive depth limits. These are safety constraints at the infrastructure level — the same thinking that matters in AI-assisted coding tools. I've built compliance into the architecture, not bolted it on after.

*Container and CLI experience.* 5 GitHub Actions workflows automate validation across the entire system. organ-audit.py runs health checks across 100 repos. I've worked with containerized environments, CI/CD pipelines, and command-line tooling at production scale.

The eight-organ system exists because I believe autonomous creative systems need the same governance rigor as production AI tools — and that building infrastructure transparently makes it better.

## Bundle 5: Together AI — Lead DX Engineer, Documentation

**Application URL:** https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/togetherai/jobs/4903661007
**Deadline:** Rolling
**Salary:** $160,000–$240,000 + equity
**Location:** SF or NYC

### Cover Letter

I'm applying for the Lead DX Engineer, Documentation role at Together AI. I've written 404,000+ words of portfolio-quality documentation for a system coordinating 100 repositories across 8 organizations — and I did it because I believe documentation is infrastructure, not decoration.

**Why Together AI**

Together AI is building the infrastructure layer for open-source AI. That infrastructure is only as useful as its documentation. I want to be the person who makes sure every developer who touches Together's APIs has the experience of something clicking — the guide that anticipated their question, the cookbook that solved their exact use case, the reference that didn't make them guess.

**What I'd Bring**

*Documentation at scale, built from scratch.* The eight-organ system has: 97 documented repositories, each with a README written for external evaluators; a reading order and cross-document dependency map so newcomers know where to start; an annotated manifest providing per-file descriptions of every document in the corpus; 42 published essays explaining architectural decisions to non-technical audiences. This wasn't a documentation pass on existing code. It was documentation-first development: the docs defined what the system would become.

*LLM and AI application experience.* agentic-titan is a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests. recursive-engine implements a symbolic operating system with a custom DSL, 21 organ handlers, and 1,254 tests. metasystem-master coordinates these subsystems at the meta-level — the kind of architecture documentation that teaches by showing how pieces compose. I understand LLM APIs — tool-use, chaining, structured outputs, function calling — because I've built production systems that depend on them.

*Code examples in Python and TypeScript.* The system includes Python validation scripts, YAML workflow specifications for 5 GitHub Actions, JSON schemas, and shell scripts for environment configuration. I write code that teaches. Every script is documented with the "why," not just the "what."

*Founding-team energy.* This is a founding documentation role. I've built documentation systems from zero before — the entire eight-organ documentation corpus was designed, structured, and shipped in a single sprint. I know how to set standards, build templates, and create processes that scale.

Documentation is infrastructure. I want to build Together AI's.

## Bundle 6: OpenAI — Software Engineer, Applied Evals

**Application URL:** https://openai.com/careers/software-engineer-applied-evals-san-francisco/
**Deadline:** Rolling
**Salary:** ~$230,000–$385,000
**Location:** SF (3 days in-office)
**Note:** URL returned 403 on automated check (Cloudflare). Verify manually in browser.

### Cover Letter

I'm applying for the Software Engineer, Applied Evals role at OpenAI. I build evaluation and validation systems for complex AI-integrated infrastructure — and I've shipped them at a scale where manual review is impossible and automated quality gates are the only thing between you and system-wide failure.

**Why Applied Evals**

Evaluation is governance. When you're evaluating multi-turn and tool-using systems, you're deciding what "good" means for an agent operating autonomously. I've made exactly these decisions for a system coordinating 100 repositories across 8 organizations: What does a healthy repo look like? What dependency patterns indicate architectural risk? When should a promotion be blocked? The answers became automated validation — organ-audit.py, platinum-validation.py, 5 GitHub Actions workflows — that runs continuously without human intervention.

That's eval infrastructure. I want to build it for the systems that matter most.

**What I'd Bring**

*Evaluation frameworks, battle-tested.* I built a multi-layered validation system: organ-audit.py (monthly health monitoring across all 100 repos), platinum-validation.py (full system sweep verifying every repo against 1,267 audited links and 31 dependency edges), validate-dependencies workflow (blocks merges that would violate constitutional constraints). These aren't toy scripts. They enforce quality at a scale where eyeballing it doesn't work.

*Agent harness design.* agentic-titan is a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests across 18 development phases. The test framework itself IS an agent harness. a-i-council--coliseum takes this further: multi-agent deliberation where AI agents debate positions and synthesize conclusions — evaluating the quality of that synthesis requires exactly the kind of multi-turn eval infrastructure this role builds.

*Production systems end-to-end.* I shipped the eight-organ system from architecture through deployment: 82+ CI/CD pipelines, automated health audits, dependency validation, promotion state machine. I own the full lifecycle.

*Feedback loops that strengthen systems.* The system uses a tiered documentation approach (Bronze/Silver/Gold) where validation results feed directly into the next sprint. Regression monitoring, golden datasets, and drift detection — these are eval patterns applied to infrastructure.

I don't just build AI agents; I build the evaluation infrastructure that makes them reliable.

## Bundle 7: Hugging Face — Developer Advocate Engineer, Hub/Enterprise

**Application URL (US):** https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/4C12FB7880
**Application URL (EMEA):** https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/E732F4B8FC
**Deadline:** Rolling
**Salary:** $120,000–$160,000 (US)
**Location:** Remote (US or EMEA)

### Cover Letter

I'm applying for the Developer Advocate Engineer role at Hugging Face. I've built a public documentation corpus of 404,000+ words across 100 repositories — not because someone assigned it, but because I believe open-source systems deserve documentation that treats every reader as someone worth teaching.

**Why Hugging Face**

I want to work in open source because I've already been doing it. The eight-organ system is 81 public repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, every one of them documented for external evaluators — not internal notes cleaned up for public consumption, but documentation-first development where the writing shaped what the system became. The .github org profile for each organ is its own piece of technical communication, designed so someone landing on the org page understands the architecture in 60 seconds.

Hugging Face hires people who tell it where to go. I'm the person who sees a gap in documentation and fills it before anyone asks — because I've learned that the distance between "powerful tool" and "tool people actually use" is almost always a documentation problem.

**What I'd Bring**

*Technical content at scale, from scratch.* 100 repository READMEs, each written for grant reviewers and hiring managers. A cross-document dependency map and reading order. An annotated manifest with per-file descriptions. 42 published essays explaining architectural decisions to non-technical audiences. organvm-corpvs-testamentvm as the meta-governance document — ~404K+ words of structured technical writing that IS the product.

*Developer-first instinct.* my-knowledge-base is a knowledge management system designed around how developers actually retrieve information. metasystem-master coordinates subsystems at the meta-level, and its documentation teaches by showing how pieces compose rather than listing features.

*Code that teaches.* Python validation scripts, YAML workflow specs, JSON schemas, and shell scripts — all documented with the "why," not just the "what."

*Open-source ownership.* I've shipped community health files, contribution guidelines, and org-level profiles across 8 organizations.

The eight-organ system is public because I believe building in the open makes the work better. I want to bring that conviction to Hugging Face.

## Bundle 8: Cohere — Applied AI Engineer, Agentic Workflows

**Application URL:** https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/cohere/1fa01a03-9253-4f62-8f10-0fe368b38cb9
**Deadline:** Rolling
**Salary:** Not disclosed
**Location:** SF, NYC, Toronto, Montreal, London (remote-flexible)

### Cover Letter

I'm applying for the Applied AI Engineer, Agentic Workflows role at Cohere. I build multi-agent orchestration systems with production governance — and I've shipped one that coordinates 100 repositories across 8 organizations using exactly the kind of constraint enforcement and evaluation infrastructure your agentic platform needs.

**Why Agentic Workflows at Cohere**

Cohere is building the enterprise layer for agentic AI. Enterprise means governance: who can an agent call, what can it access, when should it stop? I've answered these questions for a real system. The eight-organ architecture enforces constitutional constraints — no circular dependencies, no back-edges, promotion through a formal state machine — and these rules aren't suggestions. They're automated. They block merges. They run monthly audits. That's the kind of orchestration design that makes agentic workflows safe enough for enterprise customers to deploy.

**What I'd Bring**

*Multi-agent orchestration, tested at scale.* agentic-titan: 1,095 tests across 18 development phases covering agent coordination, message passing, fault tolerance, and graceful degradation.

*Agent deliberation systems.* a-i-council--coliseum implements multi-agent deliberation: AI agents with distinct perspectives debating positions and synthesizing conclusions.

*Symbolic systems with real depth.* recursive-engine--generative-entity: symbolic OS with custom DSL, 21 organ handlers, 1,254 tests at 85% coverage.

*Evaluation infrastructure as a first-class concern.* organ-audit.py, platinum-validation.py, and 5 GitHub Actions workflows enforce governance continuously.

*Documentation that scales enterprise adoption.* 404,000+ words of portfolio-quality documentation.

I build agentic systems that are governed, tested, and documented — because that's what enterprise deployment requires.

## Bundle 9: Runway — MTS, Research Tooling & Data Platform

**Application URL:** https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/runwayml/jobs/4650196005
**Deadline:** Rolling
**Salary:** $240,000–$290,000
**Location:** Remote (NA/EU)

### Cover Letter

The eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 organizations — half generative art, interactive narrative, and experiential design; half the governance, orchestration, and tooling infrastructure that makes the creative work possible at scale. metasystem-master serves as the internal tooling layer that makes the whole system navigable. I built both because creative systems need the same engineering rigor as production platforms. That's Runway's thesis, and why I'm applying for the MTS, Research Tooling & Data Platform role.

**Why Runway**

Runway's research teams need internal tooling built by someone who understands what researchers need and how to build platforms that don't get in their way. The eight-organ system required solving that problem: generative art repos need different workflows than governance infrastructure, but they share a registry, a dependency model, and a promotion pipeline. Every design choice in the tooling layer came from watching creative work get blocked by bad infrastructure — and building something better.

Runway is doing the same thing at a much larger scale. Your research teams need internal tooling built by someone who understands both what researchers need and how to build platforms that don't get in their way.

**What I'd Bring**

*Platform engineering with creative empathy.* metasystem-master coordinates subsystems at the meta-level — it's the internal tooling layer that makes the eight-organ system navigable.

*Symbolic systems and generative architecture.* recursive-engine--generative-entity: symbolic OS with custom DSL, 21 organ handlers, 1,254 tests at 85% coverage.

*Product engineering across domains.* classroom-rpg-aetheria (educational RPG) and your-fit-tailored (personalization system) — full-stack products demonstrating TypeScript/React product engineering.

*Self-directed, pragmatic execution.* I shipped the entire eight-organ system — 404K+ words of documentation, 82+ CI/CD pipelines, 5 governance workflows, a machine-readable registry — in a single concentrated sprint.

I build infrastructure that creative people actually want to use. I'd like to do that for Runway's research teams.
