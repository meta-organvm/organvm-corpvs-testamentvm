## Artist Statement

**~150 words — copy between the lines:**

---

Teaching complex systems to diverse audiences IS my creative practice.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. The 42 published essays documenting this process aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time.

I use AI tools as compositional instruments, the way Brian Eno treated the studio. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work. The result: a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, built over 5+ years and 33 development sprints.

## Project Description / Why This Opportunity

---

Eleven years teaching at 8+ institutions — 2,000+ students across 100+ courses — taught me that the most powerful pedagogy makes complex systems visible and navigable. The eight-organ system (100 repositories, 42 essays, ~410K+ of documentation) is simultaneously a creative work AND a teaching instrument: every architectural decision is documented, every mistake published, every sprint specified.

Processing Foundation Fellowship aligns precisely with the trajectory of this practice — the combination of creative rigor, technical depth, and public documentation that defines the eight-organ methodology.

## Key Differentiators (if asked "what makes you different")

1. Radical transparency at system scale — ~410K+ of documentation, 33 sprint specs, 12 ADRs, a constitution.
2. Process-as-product methodology — the 42 essays aren't marketing; they ARE the creative work.
3. Cross-domain integration — the eight-organ model bridges theory, art, commerce, governance, and community.
4. Solo production at institutional scale — one person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations.
