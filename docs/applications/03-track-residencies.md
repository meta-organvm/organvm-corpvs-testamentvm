# Track: Residencies & Fellowships

**Targets:** Eyebeam, Processing Foundation Fellowship, Somerset House / Google Creative Lab
**Identity:** Artist-engineer whose primary medium is governance and autonomous creative systems
**Core evidence:** All 8 organs as unified artistic practice + ORGAN-V transparency + ORGAN-VI community

---

## Framing

"As an artist-engineer building autonomous creative systems, I've developed a fully documented eight-organ infrastructure for coordinating theory, art, and community work."

Residency evaluators assess:
1. **Artistic practice** — Is there a coherent body of work? (8 organs, 97 repos, 5+ years)
2. **Systemic thinking** — Does the artist think beyond individual pieces? (Governance model, dependency graph, state machine)
3. **Community contribution** — Will this benefit the residency community? (ORGAN-VI, public documentation, reusable patterns)
4. **Innovation** — Is this genuinely pushing boundaries? (Governance-as-artistic-medium is uncommon)
5. **Communication** — Can the artist articulate their practice? (~386K+ words, 33 essays, clear system narrative)

## Artist Statement (Template)

> I build autonomous creative systems and treat their governance as an artistic medium.
>
> My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 97 repositories. Rather than producing individual artworks, I produce the *systems* that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work over time.
>
> This isn't project-based art. It's infrastructure-as-practice: registry design, dependency validation, promotion state machines, automated health checks, and public documentation are all artistic decisions. The choice of how work moves between organs (Theory -> Art -> Commerce) is as important as any individual output.
>
> My reference points include Julian Oliver's critical engineering (treating infrastructure as political/artistic medium), Nicky Case's Explorable Explanations (making systems visible and interactive), and Hundred Rabbits' sustainable tools (building creative infrastructure with radical transparency). Like these practitioners, I believe that protocols, governance structures, and documentation are primary artistic outputs — not supplementary.
>
> The eight-organ system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a portfolio demonstrating systems thinking, (c) an argument that governance and art are not separate categories, and (d) a reusable model that other artist-engineers can learn from.

## Target-Specific Angles

### Eyebeam

**What they value:** "Equitable systems in support of creativity." Technology as civic infrastructure. Artists who build systems, not just objects.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system IS a system in support of creativity. The public documentation (ORGAN-V), community infrastructure (ORGAN-VI), and transparent governance (ORGAN-IV) demonstrate equity-oriented design.

**Proposed residency work:**
1. Develop ORGAN-VI community programming: artist-engineer salons, governance workshops
2. Write 5+ essays documenting the residency experience within the eight-organ model
3. Create a "governance toolkit" other artists can adapt for their own practice
4. Present the eight-organ system as a case study in institutional design

**Key evidence:**
- Public governance model that anyone can inspect and learn from
- ORGAN-VI community repos designed for collaborative spaces
- ORGAN-V radical transparency — building in public as methodology
- The entire system is open-source and documented

**Talking points:**
- "I treat governance as an artistic medium — the rules that coordinate 97 repos are as carefully designed as any artwork"
- "The public documentation isn't just transparency; it's a contribution to the community of practice"
- "The eight-organ model demonstrates that a single practitioner can operate at institutional scale through documented governance"

### Processing Foundation Fellowship

**What they value:** Infrastructure that enables others. Open-source tools and documentation. Community contribution. Making creative coding more accessible.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system is reusable infrastructure. The governance model, registry design, and workflow patterns can be adapted by other creative technologists. The documentation is written to teach, not just record.

**Proposed fellowship work:**
1. Extract the governance model into a standalone toolkit: registry template, workflow templates, dependency validation patterns
2. Write a "Governance for Creative Technologists" guide based on five years of experience
3. Contribute to Processing community: workshops on systematic creative practice
4. Document the fellowship itself as ORGAN-V content

**Key evidence:**
- Templates already exist (meta-dependencies.json, workflow templates)
- Documentation written for external audiences (every README is a portfolio piece)
- Processing-adjacent tools: generative systems, interactive installations, creative coding infrastructure
- ORGAN-V public process = commitment to knowledge sharing

### Somerset House / Google Creative Lab

**What they value:** Practice-led research. Artist-engineer hybrid work. Projects at the intersection of art, technology, and society.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system IS practice-led research. It evolved over 5+ years through building, not theorizing. The recursive-engine (ORGAN-I) implements formal epistemological frameworks as working code.

**Proposed residency work:**
1. Develop an interactive installation translating the eight-organ model into physical/digital experience
2. Use recursive-engine principles to create a generative artwork for exhibition
3. Public lecture series on governance as creative practice
4. Document the entire residency process via ORGAN-V

**Key evidence:**
- recursive-engine: 1,254 tests, formal systems translated into production code
- ORGAN-II: generative art repos with interactive and performance systems
- The eight-organ model itself: systems thinking made visible and tangible
- 5+ years of sustained practice

## Practice Description (For Application Forms)

> **Discipline:** Systems Art / Creative Technology / Governance Design
>
> **Medium:** Software infrastructure, governance protocols, public documentation, generative systems
>
> **Practice summary:** I design autonomous creative systems and their governance — building infrastructure that coordinates theory, art, commerce, and community as a single integrated practice. My current body of work is the eight-organ system: 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with automated governance, public documentation (~386K+ words), and formal validation. I treat the governance model — registry design, dependency rules, promotion state machines — as artistic output equal to any individual artwork the system produces.
>
> **Duration:** 5+ years of sustained practice
>
> **Exhibition/presentation history:** [FILL IN — include talks, workshops, publications, code exhibitions]
>
> **What I would do in residency:** [CUSTOMIZE per target — see angles above]

## Key Differentiators for Residency Evaluators

1. **Governance IS the art.** This isn't an engineer who also makes art, or an artist who also codes. The governance model, registry design, and dependency rules are artistic decisions.

2. **5+ years of sustained practice.** This isn't a proposal — it's an ongoing body of work requesting a context (the residency) to deepen and share.

3. **Community-oriented by design.** ORGAN-VI exists specifically for community infrastructure. ORGAN-V makes everything public. The system is designed to contribute, not just produce.

4. **Documented and verifiable.** Every claim can be verified by visiting the public repos. The registry, governance rules, audit reports, and essays are all visible.

5. **Reusable infrastructure.** The governance model, workflow templates, and documentation patterns are designed to be adapted by other practitioners. The residency output would include a toolkit others can use.
