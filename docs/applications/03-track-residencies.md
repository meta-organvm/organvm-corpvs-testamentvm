## Framing

"I build creative systems — environments where theory, art, and community work grow like organisms in a medium. The eight-organ system coordinates 97 repositories through governance structures I designed the way a composer designs generative scores: the constraints shape what emerges."

Residency evaluators assess:
1. **Artistic practice** — Is there a coherent body of work? (8 organs, 97 repos, 5+ years of sustained practice)
2. **Systemic thinking** — Does the artist think beyond individual pieces? (Governance model, dependency graph, state machine, editorial vision across 97 repos)
3. **Community contribution** — Will this benefit the residency community? (ORGAN-VI, public documentation, reusable governance patterns)
4. **Innovation** — Is this genuinely pushing boundaries? (Solo production at institutional scale through AI-augmented methodology)
5. **Communication** — Can the artist articulate their practice? (~404K+ words, 41 essays, process documented in real-time)

## Artist Statement (Template)

> I design environments where creative organisms grow — and then I document the process of growing them.
>
> My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 97 repositories. I don't produce individual artworks. I produce the *systems* that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work — and the visible record of how those systems are built is itself the primary creative output.
>
> The process of creation is the product. The 41 essays I've published aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time. The governance rules — registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines — aren't bureaucratic overhead; they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge. Every architectural decision is an artistic decision.
>
> I work in the tradition of solo producers who became orchestras: Brian Eno treating the studio as a compositional instrument rather than a recording space; Trent Reznor building entire albums alone because nobody else would commit at the necessary intensity; Brian Wilson directing session musicians like a film director directs actors, making the album in the assembly. I use AI tools the way these practitioners used their technologies — as instruments for realizing an architectural vision, not as replacements for creative judgment.
>
> My reference points also include Julian Oliver's critical engineering, Nicky Case's Explorable Explanations, and Hundred Rabbits' radical transparency. What connects all of them is the conviction that protocols, governance structures, and systems design are primary creative outputs — not supplementary.
>
> The eight-organ system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, (c) an argument that the process of creation — made visible and governable — is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce, and (d) a reusable model other practitioners can learn from.

- Portfolio site with p5.js generative art on all pages

**Deadline:** April 1, 2026, 11:59pm (SlideRoom)

### Eyebeam — **HIGH FIT (7/10)**

**What they value:** "Equitable systems in support of creativity." Technology as civic infrastructure. Artists who build systems, not just objects.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system IS a system in support of creativity. The public documentation (ORGAN-V), community infrastructure (ORGAN-VI), and transparent governance (ORGAN-IV) demonstrate equity-oriented design.

**Proposed residency work:**
1. Develop ORGAN-VI community programming: creative-technical salons, governance workshops
2. Write 5+ essays documenting the residency experience within the eight-organ model
3. Create a "governance toolkit" other artists can adapt for their own practice
4. Present the eight-organ system as a case study in institutional design

**Key evidence:**
- Public governance model that anyone can inspect and learn from
- ORGAN-VI community repos designed for collaborative spaces
- ORGAN-V radical transparency — building in public as methodology
- The entire system is open-source and documented

**Talking points:**
- "I treat governance as an artistic medium — the rules that coordinate 97 repos are as carefully designed as any artwork"
- "The public documentation isn't just transparency; it's a contribution to the community of practice"
- "The eight-organ model demonstrates that a single practitioner can operate at institutional scale through documented governance"

**Deadline:** TBA, Spring 2026 (check Submittable portal)

### Processing Foundation Fellowship — **MODERATE FIT (6/10)**

**What they value:** Infrastructure that enables others. Open-source tools and documentation. Community contribution. Making creative coding more accessible.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system is reusable infrastructure. The governance model, registry design, and workflow patterns can be adapted by other creative technologists. The documentation is written to teach, not just record.

**Proposed fellowship work:**
1. Extract the governance model into a standalone toolkit: registry template, workflow templates, dependency validation patterns
2. Write a "Governance for Creative Technologists" guide based on five years of experience
3. Contribute to Processing community: workshops on systematic creative practice
4. Document the fellowship itself as ORGAN-V content

**Deadline:** Expected ~April-May 2026

### Google Creative Lab Five / Creative Fellowship — **HIGH FIT (8/10 Lab, 7/10 Fellowship)**

**What they value:** Practice-led research. Artist-engineer hybrid work. Projects at the intersection of art, technology, and society.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system IS practice-led research. It evolved over 5+ years through building, not theorizing. The recursive-engine (ORGAN-I) implements formal epistemological frameworks as working code.

**Proposed work:**
1. Apply the orchestration methodology to Google's creative projects
2. Bridge creative vision and AI implementation within Google's teams
3. Document the methodology for broader creative technology community

**Deadlines:** Lab Five — open (no close date). Fellowship — March 18, 2026, 5pm PST.

### Pioneer Works — **FUTURE TARGET (3-12 months)**

**What they value:** Interdisciplinary research and practice. Brooklyn-based. Art + science + technology.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system bridges art, technology, and governance. Pioneer Works' interdisciplinary ethos aligns with the cross-organ methodology.

**Amount:** $1K–$2.5K + studio space
**Timeline:** Summer 2026 application for 2027 residency

### Tulsa Artist Fellowship — **FUTURE TARGET (3-12 months)**

**What they fund:** Extraordinary support for artists: $150,000 stipend over 3 years + $12,000/year housing + studio + healthcare. **Total value: $230K+**.

**Why you fit:** Sustained creative practice with demonstrated commitment. The fellowship's generous support would enable full-time creative work.

**Requirement:** Relocation to Tulsa.
**Timeline:** Applications for 2027-2029 expected Spring 2026 (April-May).

**Benefits cliff:** $50K/year income would exit the benefits safety net entirely, but the comprehensive support package (housing + healthcare) replaces those benefits.

### NEW INC (New Museum) — **FUTURE TARGET (3-12 months)**

**What they value:** Technology-focused creative incubator. 13th cohort.

**Note:** Members pay ~$600/month. More of a co-working/incubator than a funded residency.
**Timeline:** Spring/Summer 2026 applications expected.

### Queer|Art Mentorship — **FUTURE TARGET (3-12 months)**

**What they value:** LGBTQ+ artists at a pivotal career moment. Mentorship with established artists.

**Why you fit:** LGBTQ+ identity. Creative practice at a transitional moment. The mentorship structure could provide institutional connection the practice currently lacks.

**Timeline:** Application expected Summer 2026 (~June-July).

### Lambda Literary Writers Retreat — **FUTURE TARGET (6-12 months)**

**What they value:** LGBTQ+ writers. MFA-relevant writing focus.

**Why you fit:** MFA Creative Writing + LGBTQ+ identity + 41 published essays. The essays as creative nonfiction about building creative systems.

**Timeline:** Application expected ~November 2026-January 2027.

## Practice Description (For Application Forms)

> **Discipline:** Systems Art / Creative Infrastructure / Process Design
>
> **Medium:** Software infrastructure, governance protocols, public documentation, generative systems, AI-augmented production
>
> **Practice summary:** I build creative systems — environments where creative work grows through documented governance, automated coordination, and visible process. My current body of work is the eight-organ system: 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, coordinating theory, art, commerce, and community as a single integrated practice. The system is documented at ~404K+ words across 41 essays and governance specifications, all produced through an AI-augmented methodology where I design the architecture and editorial vision while using AI tools as compositional instruments. The governance model — registry design, dependency rules, promotion pipelines — is artistic output equal to any individual work the system produces. The process of creation, made visible and governable, IS the product.

## Key Differentiators for Residency Evaluators

1. **The process IS the product.** The 41 essays, the governance specifications, the public documentation — these aren't supplements to the work. They ARE the work. The creative process, made visible and governable, is the primary output.

2. **Solo production at institutional scale.** One person coordinating 97 repositories through documented governance, using AI tools as compositional instruments. 33 named sprints, 404K+ words, 82+ CI/CD workflows — the system is evidence this mode of production works.

3. **5+ years of sustained practice.** This isn't a proposal — it's an ongoing body of work requesting a context (the residency) to deepen and share. 33 development sprints, 404K+ words, fully operational.

4. **Community-oriented by design.** ORGAN-VI exists specifically for community infrastructure. ORGAN-V makes everything public. The system is designed to contribute, not just produce.

5. **Documented and verifiable.** Every claim can be verified by visiting the public repos. The registry, governance rules, audit reports, and essays are all visible. The system practices the transparency it preaches.

6. **AI-augmented methodology as creative practice.** Using AI tools as compositional instruments — not hiding this, but making it central to the artistic identity. This is the future of creative production, and the system demonstrates it at scale.
