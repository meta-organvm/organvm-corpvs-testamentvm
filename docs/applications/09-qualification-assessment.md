# Qualification Assessment: Application Targets

**Created:** 2026-02-16
**Revised:** 2026-02-18 (strategy rewrite — added art-tech grant assessments, updated identity framing)
**Purpose:** Honest gap analysis comparing actual profile against stated requirements for each target
**Companion:** [04-application-tracker.md](./04-application-tracker.md) (fit scores recalibrated to match), [10-funding-strategy.md](./10-funding-strategy.md) (benefits cliff, deadline sequencing)

## Revision Note

The initial assessment overcorrected. It framed the gap as "0 years professional SWE experience at a company" — but none of the 7 engineering roles explicitly require "at a company." They use language like "4+ years software engineering" or capabilities-based requirements. The assessment also dismissed 18 years of professional experience across multiple domains. This revision corrects both errors: honestly acknowledging the real gaps while properly crediting transferable experience and the actual job-posting language.

## Your Actual Profile

**Education:** MFA Creative Writing (FAU, 2015–2018), BA English Literature (CUNY, 2010–2014)

**Professional experience:**
- Independent Creative Systems Designer / AI-Augmented Production (2021–present) — 5 years. Designed and built the eight-organ system: 100 repos, 2,349 tests, CI/CD, custom DSL, multi-agent orchestration. Uses AI tools as compositional instruments for solo production at institutional scale.
- College Instructor at 8+ institutions (2015–present) — 11 years. Technical explanation, curriculum design, student-facing
- AJP Media Arts, Multimedia Specialist (2011–present) — 15 years running own business, 15 clients, video/audio/web production, client management, project delivery
- Miami Dade College Foundation, Digital Marketing Manager (2023–2024) — organizational experience, cross-functional collaboration
- Majestic Design, Construction Project Manager (2007–2018) — 11 years. Execution discipline, budget management, stakeholder management, crew coordination

**Total professional experience: 18 years across 4 domains.**

**Certifications:** Meta Full-Stack Developer (2023–2024), Google UX Design / Digital Marketing / Project Management (2022–2023). Structured learning through industry certification programs.

**Identity framing (VERITAS II):** Systems artist and auteur-producer who builds creative systems. The ORGANVM system IS the creative practice — not a portfolio piece for an engineering job. Governance is the medium. The process of creation is the product. Four identity positions for different audiences: Educator, Multimedia Artist, AI Systems Architect, Community-Focused Practitioner.

**What you have built:**
- 100-repo eight-organ system with automated governance, dependency validation, CI/CD
- agentic-titan: 1,095 tests, 18 phases, multi-agent orchestration
- recursive-engine: 1,254 tests, 85% coverage, custom DSL
- ~404K+ words of documentation across the system
- 42 published essays (building in public)
- Portfolio site with generative art (p5.js on all pages, Jost+CMYK design)
- 33 named development sprints over 5+ years of sustained practice

## The Real Gaps

The engineering roles require experience that falls into four specific categories where your profile has genuine gaps:

1. **No collaborative engineering team experience** — code review with peers, sprint planning, shared production codebases, oncall/SLA environments. All 5 years of engineering work has been solo.

2. **No production deployment serving real users at scale** — 100 repos with comprehensive tests and CI/CD, but 0 users. Hiring managers at $230K–$560K companies compare against candidates who have shipped software to paying customers.

3. **No enterprise customer-facing experience in tech specifically** — 11 years of teaching IS customer-facing work (technical explanation, managing expectations, adapting to audience), but it's not the "enterprise customer" experience that roles like Anthropic FDE or Cohere explicitly require.

4. **Limited domain-specific ML knowledge** — no model training, fine-tuning, or evaluation research experience. The system uses LLM APIs (Claude, OpenAI) but doesn't train or modify models.

### What Counts (Previously Dismissed)

- **5 years independent software engineering** with demonstrable output — 100 repos, 2,349 tests, CI/CD pipelines, custom DSL, multi-agent orchestration. Job postings say "4+ years software engineering," not "4+ years at a company."
- **11 years teaching** = customer-facing, communication, technical explanation, curriculum design. This directly maps to developer advocacy and FDE roles.
- **15 years running own multimedia business** = client management, project delivery, autonomy, self-direction. Founding-stage teams value this.
- **11 years construction PM** = execution discipline, budget management, stakeholder management. This is real professional experience, not a gap.
- **Meta Full-Stack Developer cert + Google certs** = structured learning through industry programs. Not equivalent to company experience, but not "just a bootcamp credential" either.

## Assessment by Tier

### TIER A+: Highest Fit (Art-Tech Grants — Apply Immediately)

#### Creative Capital 2027 Open Call — Realistic fit: 9/10
- **Requirement:** 5+ years professional artistic practice, "formally and/or conceptually innovative works"
- **Why you qualify:** The eight-organ system is a 5+ year sustained creative practice that is formally innovative (governance-as-art, AI-augmented methodology) and conceptually innovative (process-as-product, solo production at institutional scale). Creative Capital explicitly funds technology as a sub-discipline. Up to $50,000 + professional development services + new State of the Art Prize.
- **Advantage:** The ORGANVM system as a living creative work is exactly what Creative Capital exists to fund. 42 essays document the practice in real-time. 100 repos demonstrate sustained commitment. The "process of creation IS the product" thesis is genuinely novel. Panelist advice: "Describe your project with the clarity of a children's book" — the system has a clear, communicable thesis.
- **Risk:** Highly competitive (thousands of applications for ~40 awards). Application opens Mar 2, due Apr 2.
- **Action:** Begin preparing materials now, submit April 2
- **Benefits cliff:** $50K would exceed Medicaid threshold → Essential Plan ($0 premium). Call NYLAG before accepting.

#### Artadia NYC Awards — Realistic fit: 8/10
- **Requirement:** Contemporary visual artist, NYC-based, work presented in contemporary art context
- **Why you qualify:** MFA provides creative credibility. The eight-organ system IS the artistic practice — governance as medium, process as product. Portfolio site with generative art (p5.js) demonstrates visual practice. NYC-based. Unrestricted $15,000 grant, 3 awardees per cycle.
- **Advantage:** Unrestricted funds — no project proposal required, just evidence of sustained practice. The system's public documentation makes every claim verifiable. Strong institutional framing (8 orgs, 100 repos, automated governance = institutional scale).
- **Risk:** "Contemporary visual artist" framing — the system is more conceptual/systems art than traditional visual art. Need to frame the portfolio site, generative art repos, and interactive installations as the visual practice.
- **Action:** Submit by March 1 via Submittable
- **Benefits cliff:** SNAP-safe (lump sum excluded). $15K on $12K base stays below Medicaid threshold with Schedule C deductions.

### TIER A: Strong Realistic Fit (Apply with confidence)

#### Google Creative Lab Five — Realistic fit: 8/10
- **Requirement:** "0+ years" creative experience
- **Why you qualify:** Five years of creative-technical practice documented across 100 repos. MFA supports creative credibility. Portfolio with generative art, p5.js sketches, eight-organ system as "governance-as-art." Lab Five has no minimum experience requirement.
- **Advantage:** Your profile IS the profile they're looking for — creative technologists who think systemically.
- **Action:** Submit immediately (no deadline, materials ready)

#### Google Creative Fellowship — Realistic fit: 7/10
- **Requirement:** "0–5 years" creative experience, practice-led research
- **Why you qualify:** Same strengths as Lab Five. MFA + five years of the eight-organ system as sustained practice. The "governance as artistic medium" framing is genuinely novel.
- **Risk:** More competitive than Lab Five. March 18 deadline.
- **Action:** Submit by March 18

#### Eyebeam "Speculating on Plurality" — Realistic fit: 7/10
- **Requirement:** Emerging NYC-based artist, first decade of professional career
- **Why you qualify:** NYC-based. The governance-as-art framing directly matches "Speculating on Plurality" (imagining new frameworks). ORGAN-VI community infrastructure. Public process methodology. MFA and creative background make the "artist" claim credible.
- **Risk:** $4,000 stipend (modest). "Emerging artist" may be interpreted narrowly.
- **Action:** Monitor for open call, prepare materials

#### Fire Island Artist Residency — Realistic fit: 7/10
- **Requirement:** LGBTQ+ emerging visual artist
- **Why you qualify:** LGBTQ+ identity is a direct match. "Emerging" status appropriate — first decade of professional art career (2021-present). NYC-adjacent. Stipend + housing.
- **Advantage:** Strong identity match. The systems-art practice is genuinely emerging (5 years). Housing component addresses a real need.
- **Risk:** "Visual artist" interpretation — need to frame generative art, portfolio site, and interactive installations as visual practice. Competition from traditional visual artists.
- **Action:** Submit by April 1 via SlideRoom

### TIER B: Realistic Stretch (Apply with clear angle)

#### Together AI Lead DX Engineer ($160K–$240K) — Realistic fit: 6/10 (was: 4/10)
- **Requirement:** "5+ years technical writing/engineering/developer education"
- **What works:** "Developer education" explicitly qualifies you — 11 years teaching + ~404K+ words of documentation. Founding-team aspect means culture-shaping, which favors unconventional backgrounds. The role is documentation-first, not engineering-first.
- **What doesn't:** "Lead" title expects someone who has led documentation at a tech company. They want LLM API docs, function-calling guides, structured output cookbooks — for products with paying users. No tech-company doc leadership.
- **Realistic angle:** Teaching + writing is a legitimate path into this role. "Lead" is the main barrier, but founding-stage teams often hire for trajectory.

#### Processing Foundation Fellowship — Realistic fit: 6/10
- **Requirement:** Infrastructure that enables others, community contribution
- **Why you qualify:** The governance toolkit concept is genuinely useful. Documentation skills are real. Open-source commitment demonstrated.
- **Risk:** More technical processing/p5.js community expected. Work is adjacent, not central.
- **Action:** Apply when it opens (~April–May 2026)

#### HuggingFace Developer Advocate ($120K–$160K) — Realistic fit: 5/10 (was: 4/10)
- **Requirement:** No years requirement — purely skills-based. "Deeply technical, not a marketing position." Create docs, blog posts, tutorials; build demos; contribute to Transformers/Datasets libraries.
- **What works:** Documentation volume and quality are proven (~404K+ words, 42 essays). Self-directed operator. Writing quality. Remote-first. HuggingFace hires 30–40% from community — unconventional backgrounds are normal.
- **What doesn't:** No published ML tutorials or blog posts. No contributions to HF libraries. No professional ML experience. "Deeply technical" means debugging transformer training loops and model evaluation.
- **Realistic angle:** Content creation is demonstrated at scale. The gap is ML-specific content, not content ability. Skills-based evaluation favors you more than credential-based roles.

---

### TIER C: Competitive Reach (Apply, calibrate expectations)

#### Anthropic FDE, Custom Agents ($280K–$400K) — Realistic fit: 4/10 (was: 2/10)
- **Requirement:** "4+ years technical customer-facing role," "production LLM experience"
- **What works:** 11 years of teaching IS a technical customer-facing role — explaining complex concepts, managing expectations, adapting to audience needs. Agent development demonstrated (agentic-titan, orchestration system). Python, eval frameworks, MCP server experience all directly relevant.
- **What doesn't:** Not the traditional SE→FDE pipeline (Google/Meta engineer pivoting to client-facing). "Production LLM experience" typically means enterprise deployments, not personal projects. The $280K–$400K comp level attracts strong credentialed competition.
- **Why not lower:** FDE roles explicitly value autonomy + communication + teaching ability. The agent skills are directly demonstrated. It's a reach, not impossible.

#### OpenAI SE, Applied Evals ($230K–$385K) — Realistic fit: 4/10 (was: 2/10)
- **Requirement:** "4+ years software engineering," "shipping production systems end-to-end"
- **What works:** "4+ years software engineering" doesn't say "at a company." 5 years of independent SWE with evaluation infrastructure, multi-agent workflows, tool use, and 2,349 tests across the system. The eval infrastructure focus maps directly to your validation/testing work.
- **What doesn't:** "Shipping production systems end-to-end" typically means to real users at scale. 100 repos with 0 users is the core gap. Competition is candidates from Google, Meta, Stripe with shipped production systems.
- **Why not lower:** The posting language is genuinely capability-based, and your capabilities in eval infrastructure are real.

---

### TIER D: Long Shot (Apply if time permits)

#### Runway MTS ($240K–$290K) — Realistic fit: 3/10 (was: 2/10)
- **Requirement:** "4+ years backend-focused engineering," strong in ML domain knowledge or platform infrastructure
- **What works:** Platform/infrastructure experience (CI/CD, Docker, PostgreSQL, multi-repo orchestration) is partially demonstrated. Artist-engineer identity matches Runway's mission.
- **What doesn't:** ML domain knowledge is limited. Product engineering for real users: not demonstrated. "4+ years backend-focused" — your backend work is orchestration tooling, not user-facing product backends.
- **Realistic outcome:** Weakest of the engineering reaches. Apply if time permits.

#### Cohere Applied AI Engineer — Realistic fit: 3/10 (was: 2/10)
- **Requirement:** "Production engineering," "enterprise customer experience," "hands-on multi-step reasoning agents"
- **What works:** Multi-agent reasoning demonstrated (agentic-titan, council deliberation). Evaluation frameworks built. Broadest geographic flexibility (SF/NYC/Toronto/Montreal/London).
- **What doesn't:** "Enterprise customer experience" is explicit and real — you have 0 enterprise tech customers. "Production engineering" means deployed systems serving paying users.
- **Realistic outcome:** The "enterprise customer" requirement is a hard filter that teaching experience doesn't offset.

#### Anthropic SE, Claude Code ($320K–$560K) — Realistic fit: 3/10 (was: 1/10)
- **Requirement:** "5+ years experience," "expert React (hooks, context, suspense)," "safety/compliance project experience"
- **What works:** 5+ years of independent SWE experience exists. Safety-as-governance thinking maps to compliance work. Deep familiarity with Claude Code as a power user.
- **What doesn't:** $320K–$560K is staff/senior-staff level. "Expert React" means React applications used by millions — portfolio site is not that. Competition is 7–15 year veterans from top companies.
- **Realistic outcome:** The comp level and "expert React" specificity make this the hardest engineering target. Worth applying to but lowest expected return.

### TIER E: Not Viable (Do not invest time)

#### Knight Foundation — Realistic fit: 1/10
- Geographically restricted to Akron, Detroit, Miami. You are in NYC. Likely ineligible. **DROP.**

#### Mellon Foundation — Realistic fit: 0/10
- Invitation-only. Cannot apply. Not a target. **DROP.**

#### NEA Grants for Arts Projects — Realistic fit: 1/10
- Requires 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. You are an individual. Would need a fiscal sponsor. Federal arts funding currently unstable. **DROP.**

## Where You're Strong Right Now

- **Roles that value documentation, teaching, communication, autonomy, and systems thinking** — Together AI, Processing Foundation, HuggingFace
- **Roles that are skills-based rather than credential-based** — HuggingFace, creative residencies, Processing Foundation
- **Roles at founding-stage teams** where unconventional backgrounds are an asset — Together AI
- **The creative-tech pipeline** — Lab Five → Fellowship → Google credential builds institutional credibility

## What Would Strengthen Engineering Applications

1. **Deploy one tool with real users** — even 100 users is more credible to engineering hiring managers than 100 repos with 0. This is the single highest-leverage gap to close.

2. **Contribute to an open-source project that isn't yours** — demonstrates collaborative engineering (code review, working in someone else's codebase, responding to maintainer feedback). HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain, or similar.

3. **The engineering roles aren't impossible — they're competitive.** You're not competing from zero, you're competing from a non-traditional position with demonstrable technical output. Calibrate expectations, not aspirations.

4. **Anthropic AI Safety Fellowship** ($3,850/week, 4 months, 40% conversion to full-time) remains a viable alternative path into Anthropic specifically, though it still requires ML safety research experience.

## Summary

**Strongest assets:** 5 years of sustained creative-technical practice (100 repos, 33 sprints, 2,349 tests, CI/CD, custom DSL, multi-agent orchestration), 18 years of professional experience across 4 domains, systems thinking, documentation quality (~404K+ words), creative-technical hybridity, self-direction, and testing discipline. 42 published essays documenting the practice in real-time.

**The engineering gap is real but specific:** No collaborative team engineering, no production deployment to real users, no enterprise customer-facing tech experience, limited ML domain knowledge. These matter for engineering roles at $230K–$560K but are irrelevant for art-tech grants and residencies.

**Best immediate ROI — art-tech grants (NEW):** Creative Capital ($50K, 9/10 fit, Apr 2), Artadia NYC ($15K, 8/10 fit, Mar 1), Google Creative Lab Five (8/10, no deadline). These targets are designed for creative technologists with systematic practice — the exact profile you have. The ORGANVM system framed as living creative work is a much stronger application than the same system framed as engineering experience.

**Best stretch plays:** Together AI (6/10, documentation + teaching), HuggingFace (5/10, skills-based), Anthropic FDE (4/10, teaching-as-customer-facing).

**Strategy shift (2026-02-17):** The previous assessment focused almost entirely on engineering roles, where the profile is weakest. The art-tech funding landscape — Creative Capital, Artadia, Eyebeam, Fire Island, Processing Foundation, Spencer — is where the profile is strongest. The system IS the artwork. The engineering roles are worth applying to selectively, but the highest-ROI path is art-tech grants + consulting ($100-125/hr) + selective employment, not a sprint to a $200K+ engineering job.

**Benefits cliff awareness:** SNAP excludes lump-sum grants entirely. Medicaid threshold $21,597/yr → Essential Plan ($0 premium) up to $39,125. Fair Fares cliff $22,692. Call NYLAG (212-613-5000) before any single grant >$5K. See [10-funding-strategy.md](./10-funding-strategy.md) for full analysis.
