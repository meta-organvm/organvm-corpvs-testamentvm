# Qualification Assessment: 13 Application Targets

**Created:** 2026-02-16
**Revised:** 2026-02-16 (corrected framing — see Revision Note below)
**Purpose:** Honest gap analysis comparing actual profile against stated requirements for each target
**Companion:** [04-application-tracker.md](./04-application-tracker.md) (fit scores recalibrated to match)

## Revision Note

The initial assessment overcorrected. It framed the gap as "0 years professional SWE experience at a company" — but none of the 7 engineering roles explicitly require "at a company." They use language like "4+ years software engineering" or capabilities-based requirements. The assessment also dismissed 18 years of professional experience across multiple domains. This revision corrects both errors: honestly acknowledging the real gaps while properly crediting transferable experience and the actual job-posting language.

## The Real Gaps

The engineering roles require experience that falls into four specific categories where your profile has genuine gaps:

1. **No collaborative engineering team experience** — code review with peers, sprint planning, shared production codebases, oncall/SLA environments. All 5 years of engineering work has been solo.

2. **No production deployment serving real users at scale** — 97 repos with comprehensive tests and CI/CD, but 0 users. Hiring managers at $230K–$560K companies compare against candidates who have shipped software to paying customers.

3. **No enterprise customer-facing experience in tech specifically** — 11 years of teaching IS customer-facing work (technical explanation, managing expectations, adapting to audience), but it's not the "enterprise customer" experience that roles like Anthropic FDE or Cohere explicitly require.

4. **Limited domain-specific ML knowledge** — no model training, fine-tuning, or evaluation research experience. The system uses LLM APIs (Claude, OpenAI) but doesn't train or modify models.

### What Counts (Previously Dismissed)

- **5 years independent software engineering** with demonstrable output — 97 repos, 2,349 tests, CI/CD pipelines, custom DSL, multi-agent orchestration. Job postings say "4+ years software engineering," not "4+ years at a company."
- **11 years teaching** = customer-facing, communication, technical explanation, curriculum design. This directly maps to developer advocacy and FDE roles.
- **15 years running own multimedia business** = client management, project delivery, autonomy, self-direction. Founding-stage teams value this.
- **11 years construction PM** = execution discipline, budget management, stakeholder management. This is real professional experience, not a gap.
- **Meta Full-Stack Developer cert + Google certs** = structured learning through industry programs. Not equivalent to company experience, but not "just a bootcamp credential" either.

## Assessment by Tier

### TIER A: Strong Realistic Fit (Apply with confidence)

#### Google Creative Lab Five — Realistic fit: 8/10
- **Requirement:** "0+ years" creative experience
- **Why you qualify:** Genuine artist-engineer practice. MFA supports creative credibility. Portfolio with generative art, p5.js sketches, eight-organ system as "governance-as-art." Lab Five has no minimum experience requirement.
- **Advantage:** Your profile IS the profile they're looking for — creative technologists who think systemically.
- **Action:** Submit immediately (no deadline, materials ready)

#### Google Creative Fellowship — Realistic fit: 7/10
- **Requirement:** "0–5 years" creative experience, practice-led research
- **Why you qualify:** Same strengths as Lab Five. MFA + five years of the eight-organ system as sustained practice. The "governance as artistic medium" framing is genuinely novel.
- **Risk:** More competitive than Lab Five. March 18 deadline.
- **Action:** Submit by March 18

#### Eyebeam "Speculating on Plurality" — Realistic fit: 7/10
- **Requirement:** Emerging NYC-based artist, first decade of professional career
- **Why you qualify:** NYC-based. The governance-as-art framing directly matches "Speculating on Plurality" (imagining new frameworks). ORGAN-VI community infrastructure. Public process methodology. MFA and creative background make the "artist" claim credible.
- **Risk:** $4,000 stipend (modest). "Emerging artist" may be interpreted narrowly.
- **Action:** Monitor for open call, prepare materials

---

### TIER B: Realistic Stretch (Apply with clear angle)

#### Together AI Lead DX Engineer ($160K–$240K) — Realistic fit: 6/10 (was: 4/10)
- **Requirement:** "5+ years technical writing/engineering/developer education"
- **What works:** "Developer education" explicitly qualifies you — 11 years teaching + ~386K+ words of documentation. Founding-team aspect means culture-shaping, which favors unconventional backgrounds. The role is documentation-first, not engineering-first.
- **What doesn't:** "Lead" title expects someone who has led documentation at a tech company. They want LLM API docs, function-calling guides, structured output cookbooks — for products with paying users. No tech-company doc leadership.
- **Realistic angle:** Teaching + writing is a legitimate path into this role. "Lead" is the main barrier, but founding-stage teams often hire for trajectory.

#### Processing Foundation Fellowship — Realistic fit: 6/10
- **Requirement:** Infrastructure that enables others, community contribution
- **Why you qualify:** The governance toolkit concept is genuinely useful. Documentation skills are real. Open-source commitment demonstrated.
- **Risk:** More technical processing/p5.js community expected. Work is adjacent, not central.
- **Action:** Apply when it opens (~April–May 2026)

#### HuggingFace Developer Advocate ($120K–$160K) — Realistic fit: 5/10 (was: 4/10)
- **Requirement:** No years requirement — purely skills-based. "Deeply technical, not a marketing position." Create docs, blog posts, tutorials; build demos; contribute to Transformers/Datasets libraries.
- **What works:** Documentation volume and quality are proven (~386K+ words, 29 essays). Self-directed operator. Writing quality. Remote-first. HuggingFace hires 30–40% from community — unconventional backgrounds are normal.
- **What doesn't:** No published ML tutorials or blog posts. No contributions to HF libraries. No professional ML experience. "Deeply technical" means debugging transformer training loops and model evaluation.
- **Realistic angle:** Content creation is demonstrated at scale. The gap is ML-specific content, not content ability. Skills-based evaluation favors you more than credential-based roles.

---

### TIER C: Competitive Reach (Apply, calibrate expectations)

#### Anthropic FDE, Custom Agents ($280K–$400K) — Realistic fit: 4/10 (was: 2/10)
- **Requirement:** "4+ years technical customer-facing role," "production LLM experience"
- **What works:** 11 years of teaching IS a technical customer-facing role — explaining complex concepts, managing expectations, adapting to audience needs. Agent development demonstrated (agentic-titan, orchestration system). Python, eval frameworks, MCP server experience all directly relevant.
- **What doesn't:** Not the traditional SE→FDE pipeline (Google/Meta engineer pivoting to client-facing). "Production LLM experience" typically means enterprise deployments, not personal projects. The $280K–$400K comp level attracts strong credentialed competition.
- **Why not lower:** FDE roles explicitly value autonomy + communication + teaching ability. The agent skills are directly demonstrated. It's a reach, not impossible.

#### OpenAI SE, Applied Evals ($230K–$385K) — Realistic fit: 4/10 (was: 2/10)
- **Requirement:** "4+ years software engineering," "shipping production systems end-to-end"
- **What works:** "4+ years software engineering" doesn't say "at a company." 5 years of independent SWE with evaluation infrastructure, multi-agent workflows, tool use, and 2,349 tests across the system. The eval infrastructure focus maps directly to your validation/testing work.
- **What doesn't:** "Shipping production systems end-to-end" typically means to real users at scale. 97 repos with 0 users is the core gap. Competition is candidates from Google, Meta, Stripe with shipped production systems.
- **Why not lower:** The posting language is genuinely capability-based, and your capabilities in eval infrastructure are real.

### TIER D: Long Shot (Apply if time permits)

#### Runway MTS ($240K–$290K) — Realistic fit: 3/10 (was: 2/10)
- **Requirement:** "4+ years backend-focused engineering," strong in ML domain knowledge or platform infrastructure
- **What works:** Platform/infrastructure experience (CI/CD, Docker, PostgreSQL, multi-repo orchestration) is partially demonstrated. Artist-engineer identity matches Runway's mission.
- **What doesn't:** ML domain knowledge is limited. Product engineering for real users: not demonstrated. "4+ years backend-focused" — your backend work is orchestration tooling, not user-facing product backends.
- **Realistic outcome:** Weakest of the engineering reaches. Apply if time permits.

#### Cohere Applied AI Engineer — Realistic fit: 3/10 (was: 2/10)
- **Requirement:** "Production engineering," "enterprise customer experience," "hands-on multi-step reasoning agents"
- **What works:** Multi-agent reasoning demonstrated (agentic-titan, council deliberation). Evaluation frameworks built. Broadest geographic flexibility (SF/NYC/Toronto/Montreal/London).
- **What doesn't:** "Enterprise customer experience" is explicit and real — you have 0 enterprise tech customers. "Production engineering" means deployed systems serving paying users.
- **Realistic outcome:** The "enterprise customer" requirement is a hard filter that teaching experience doesn't offset.

#### Anthropic SE, Claude Code ($320K–$560K) — Realistic fit: 3/10 (was: 1/10)
- **Requirement:** "5+ years experience," "expert React (hooks, context, suspense)," "safety/compliance project experience"
- **What works:** 5+ years of independent SWE experience exists. Safety-as-governance thinking maps to compliance work. Deep familiarity with Claude Code as a power user.
- **What doesn't:** $320K–$560K is staff/senior-staff level. "Expert React" means React applications used by millions — portfolio site is not that. Competition is 7–15 year veterans from top companies.
- **Realistic outcome:** The comp level and "expert React" specificity make this the hardest engineering target. Worth applying to but lowest expected return.

### TIER E: Not Viable (Do not invest time)

#### Knight Foundation — Realistic fit: 1/10
- Geographically restricted to Akron, Detroit, Miami. You are in NYC. Likely ineligible. **DROP.**

#### Mellon Foundation — Realistic fit: 0/10
- Invitation-only. Cannot apply. Not a target. **DROP.**

#### NEA Grants for Arts Projects — Realistic fit: 1/10
- Requires 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. You are an individual. Would need a fiscal sponsor. Federal arts funding currently unstable. **DROP.**

## Where You're Strong Right Now

- **Roles that value documentation, teaching, communication, autonomy, and systems thinking** — Together AI, Processing Foundation, HuggingFace
- **Roles that are skills-based rather than credential-based** — HuggingFace, creative residencies, Processing Foundation
- **Roles at founding-stage teams** where unconventional backgrounds are an asset — Together AI
- **The creative-tech pipeline** — Lab Five → Fellowship → Google credential builds institutional credibility

## What Would Strengthen Engineering Applications

1. **Deploy one tool with real users** — even 100 users is more credible to engineering hiring managers than 97 repos with 0. This is the single highest-leverage gap to close.

2. **Contribute to an open-source project that isn't yours** — demonstrates collaborative engineering (code review, working in someone else's codebase, responding to maintainer feedback). HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain, or similar.

3. **The engineering roles aren't impossible — they're competitive.** You're not competing from zero, you're competing from a non-traditional position with demonstrable technical output. Calibrate expectations, not aspirations.

4. **Anthropic AI Safety Fellowship** ($3,850/week, 4 months, 40% conversion to full-time) remains a viable alternative path into Anthropic specifically, though it still requires ML safety research experience.

## Summary

**Your strongest assets are real:** 5 years of independent software engineering (97 repos, 2,349 tests, CI/CD, custom DSL, multi-agent orchestration), 18 years of professional experience across 4 domains, systems thinking, documentation quality, creative-technical hybridity, self-direction, and testing discipline. The eight-organ system is genuinely impressive.

**The gap is also real — but it's specific:** The gap is collaborative team engineering experience and production deployment to real users, not experience itself. No code review with peers. No shared production codebase. No shipping to paying customers. These are the specific things hiring managers at $230K–$560K companies are checking for.

**Best immediate ROI:** Google Creative Lab Five and Google Creative Fellowship. These are designed for people with your exact profile — creative technologists with systematic practice. Submit Lab Five today. Submit Creative Fellowship by March 18.

**Best stretch plays:** Together AI (documentation + teaching angle), HuggingFace (skills-based, no years requirement), and Anthropic FDE (teaching-as-customer-facing + agent skills).

**The engineering roles are competitive reaches from a non-traditional background.** Your 5 years of independent engineering work and 18 years of professional experience are real — the gap is collaborative team experience and production deployment to real users, not experience itself. The creative-tech and documentation roles are where your profile is strongest today. The engineering roles are worth applying to — just calibrate expectations.
