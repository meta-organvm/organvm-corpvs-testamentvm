## Deadline Research: COMPLETED 2026-02-11

### Urgency-Ordered Action Plan

| Priority | Target | Deadline | Action |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Google Creative Lab Five | Open (no stated close) | **READY TO SUBMIT** — portfolio + resume + short answers drafted |
| 2 | Google Creative Fellowship | **March 18, 2026** | Submit by March 18 5pm PST — materials ready |
| 3 | Anthropic / OpenAI / HF | Rolling | Submit by end of Feb |
| 4 | Eyebeam | Spring 2026 (TBA) | Prepare materials, monitor for open call |
| 5 | Processing Foundation | ~April-May 2026 | Prepare materials, watch for announcement |

| 7 | NEA GAP 2 | July 9, 2026 | Find fiscal sponsor if pursuing |

### Key Findings from Research
- **Knight Foundation** Art+Tech is geographically restricted to Akron/Detroit/Miami — may need substitute
- **Mellon Foundation** is invitation-only — not a viable near-term target
- **NEA** requires 501(c)(3) — needs fiscal sponsor; federal arts funding currently unstable
- **Google Creative Fellowship** deadline confirmed as **March 18, 2026** (not Feb 22 — that was stale 2025 data)
- **Eyebeam** and **Processing Foundation** both open in Spring 2026 — good targets for Week 5-6
- **AI roles** are rolling — can submit anytime but sooner is better

### Substitute Targets (if primary targets are ineligible)
- **Creative Capital** — supports individual artists, no geographic restriction
- **MAP Fund** — live performance and interdisciplinary work
- **NEW INC** (New Museum) — technology-focused incubator
- **Rhizome** — digital art commissions
- **Ford Foundation Creativity and Free Expression** — larger grants, more competitive
