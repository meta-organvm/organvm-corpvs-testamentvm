## What Changed (2026-02-17 Strategy Rewrite)

**Before:** 10 targets — 7 engineering (3-6/10 fit), 2 residencies (6-7/10), 3 dead grants (0-1/10). Strategy assumed "get a $200K+ engineering job" as primary path.

**After:** 23 targets across 5 tracks — 7 art-tech grants/residencies (6-9/10), 4 emergency/rolling funds, 4 selective employment (4-6/10), 3 consulting tracks, 5 career-building. Strategy is benefits-cliff-aware, deadline-sequenced, and recovery-informed.

**Key shifts:**
- Creative Capital ($50K, 9/10 fit) is now the highest-priority target, not Anthropic FDE ($280K, 4/10 fit)
- Artadia NYC ($15K, 8/10 fit, Mar 1 deadline) is the most urgent action item
- 3 dead grants (Knight/Mellon/NEA) replaced with 7+ verified live targets
- Engineering roles deprioritized to Track 3 — apply selectively, calibrate expectations
- Consulting track added at $100-125/hr minimum (corrected from $60/hr)
- Benefits cliff awareness integrated into every target assessment
- Recovery-informed staging: stabilization → light production → full execution
