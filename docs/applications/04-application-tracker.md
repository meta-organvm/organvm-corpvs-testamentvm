## Deadline Research: COMPLETED 2026-02-11

### Recalibrated Priority Queue (2026-02-16)

Priorities reordered by realistic fit score. See [09-qualification-assessment.md](./09-qualification-assessment.md) for full rationale.

| Priority | Target | Fit | Deadline | Action |
|----------|--------|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | Google Creative Lab Five | **8/10** | Open (no close date) | **SUBMIT NOW** — highest-ROI target |
| 2 | Google Creative Fellowship | **7/10** | **March 18, 2026** | Submit by deadline |
| 3 | Eyebeam | **7/10** | Spring 2026 (TBA) | Monitor for open call |

| 9 | Runway MTS | 3/10 | Rolling | Apply if time permits |
| 10 | Cohere Applied AI | 3/10 | Rolling | Apply if time permits |
| 11 | Anthropic SE Claude Code | 3/10 | Rolling | Apply if time permits |
| — | Knight Foundation | 1/10 | June 2026 | **DROP** (NYC, not Akron/Detroit/Miami) |
| — | Mellon Foundation | 0/10 | N/A | **DROP** (invitation-only) |
| — | NEA GAP 2 | 1/10 | July 2026 | **DROP** (requires 501(c)(3)) |

### Key Findings from Research
- **Knight Foundation** Art+Tech is geographically restricted to Akron/Detroit/Miami — may need substitute
- **Mellon Foundation** is invitation-only — not a viable near-term target
- **NEA** requires 501(c)(3) — needs fiscal sponsor; federal arts funding currently unstable
- **Google Creative Fellowship** deadline confirmed as **March 18, 2026** (not Feb 22 — that was stale 2025 data)
- **Eyebeam** and **Processing Foundation** both open in Spring 2026 — good targets for Week 5-6
- **AI roles** are rolling — can submit anytime but sooner is better

### Key Findings from AI Engineering Role Research (2026-02-11)
- **Anthropic** has 414 open positions; FDE Custom Agents ($280K-$400K) and SE Claude Code ($320K-$560K) are top fits on paper
- **OpenAI** uses Ashby for hiring; Applied Evals role maps directly to validation/eval infrastructure experience
- **Together AI** has a rare founding documentation role (Lead DX Engineer) — strongest documentation match
- **HuggingFace** hires 30-40% from open-source community; fully remote; values self-directed operators
- **Cohere** offers broadest geographic flexibility (SF/NYC/Toronto/Montreal/London)
- **Runway** is fully remote NA/EU; "merging art and science" mission aligns with artist-engineer identity
- **Mistral** roles are Paris-based — deprioritized unless willing to relocate
- **Profile gap:** Most ML research roles require PyTorch/model training experience; strongest fit is systems/orchestration/docs roles
- Full research: docs/applications/06-ai-engineering-role-research.md

### Qualification Assessment (2026-02-16, revised)
- **Profile:** 5 years independent software engineering (2021–present), 18 years total professional experience across 4 domains
- **Real gaps:** No collaborative team engineering, no production deployment to real users, no enterprise customer-facing tech experience, limited ML domain knowledge
- **What counts:** Job postings say "4+ years software engineering" not "at a company." 11yr teaching IS customer-facing. 15yr running own business IS professional experience.
- **Highest-ROI targets:** Google Creative Lab Five (8/10) and Google Creative Fellowship (7/10) — designed for creative technologists
- **Best stretch plays:** Together AI (6/10, documentation + teaching), HuggingFace (5/10, skills-based), Anthropic FDE (4/10, teaching-as-customer-facing)
- **Engineering roles are competitive reaches** from a non-traditional background — worth applying, calibrate expectations
- Full assessment: [09-qualification-assessment.md](./09-qualification-assessment.md)

### Substitute Targets (if primary targets are ineligible)
- **Creative Capital** — supports individual artists, no geographic restriction
- **MAP Fund** — live performance and interdisciplinary work
- **NEW INC** (New Museum) — technology-focused incubator
- **Rhizome** — digital art commissions
- **Ford Foundation Creativity and Free Expression** — larger grants, more competitive
