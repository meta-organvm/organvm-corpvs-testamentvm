### Key Findings from Research
- **Knight Foundation** Art+Tech is geographically restricted to Akron/Detroit/Miami — may need substitute
- **Mellon Foundation** is invitation-only — not a viable near-term target
- **NEA** requires 501(c)(3) — needs fiscal sponsor; federal arts funding currently unstable
- **Google Creative Fellowship** deadline confirmed as **March 18, 2026** (not Feb 22 — that was stale 2025 data)
- **Eyebeam** and **Processing Foundation** both open in Spring 2026 — good targets for Week 5-6
- **AI roles** are rolling — can submit anytime but sooner is better

### Key Findings from AI Engineering Role Research (2026-02-11)
- **Anthropic** has 414 open positions; FDE Custom Agents ($280K-$400K) and SE Claude Code ($320K-$560K) are top fits
- **OpenAI** uses Ashby for hiring; Applied Evals role maps directly to validation/eval infrastructure experience
- **Together AI** has a rare founding documentation role (Lead DX Engineer) — 9/10 fit for documentation-strong profile
- **HuggingFace** hires 30-40% from open-source community; fully remote; values self-directed operators
- **Cohere** offers broadest geographic flexibility (SF/NYC/Toronto/Montreal/London); agentic workflows role strong
- **Runway** is fully remote NA/EU; "merging art and science" mission directly matches artist-engineer identity
- **Mistral** roles are Paris-based — deprioritized unless willing to relocate
- **Profile gap:** Most ML research roles require PyTorch/model training experience; strongest fit is systems/orchestration/docs roles
- Full research: docs/applications/06-ai-engineering-role-research.md

### Substitute Targets (if primary targets are ineligible)
- **Creative Capital** — supports individual artists, no geographic restriction
- **MAP Fund** — live performance and interdisciplinary work
- **NEW INC** (New Museum) — technology-focused incubator
- **Rhizome** — digital art commissions
- **Ford Foundation Creativity and Free Expression** — larger grants, more competitive
