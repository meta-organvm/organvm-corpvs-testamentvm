## What Changed

### Research Integration (2026-02-17)

**Before:** 23 targets across 5 tracks.

**After:** 38 targets across 6 tracks — 15 art-tech grants/residencies (6-9/10), 7 emergency/rolling funds, 4 selective employment (4-6/10), 3 consulting tracks, 4 writing income, 5 career-building.

**Key additions from exhaustive research:**
- Prix Ars Electronica (EUR 10K, 8/10, Mar 4) and S+T+ARTS Prize (EUR 20K, 8/10, Mar 4) — **urgent international prizes**
- PEN America Writers Aid ($3,500, 9/10, rolling) — **highest-fit emergency fund**
- WFF Housing Stability ($30K/3yr, 9/10, Apr 14) — **highest-value NYC opportunity**
- Whiting Nonfiction ($40K, 8/10, ~Apr) — the 404K-word corpus as book pitch
- Headlands Center (fully funded, 9/10), ZKM (8/10), NLnet (7/10), Recurse Center (9/10)
- **NEW Track 6: Writing Income** — Noema ($1/word), Logic ($1,200-2K), GLR ($250), MIT TR ($1-3/word)
- Warhol Arts Writers ($15K-50K, 7/10, May 1), Awesome Foundation ($1K, monthly), Stimpunks ($3K)

### Strategy Rewrite (2026-02-17)

**Before (original):** 10 targets — 7 engineering (3-6/10 fit), 2 residencies (6-7/10), 3 dead grants (0-1/10).

**Shifts:** Creative Capital 9/10 replaced Anthropic 4/10 as top target. Engineering deprioritized to Track 3. Benefits cliff awareness integrated. Recovery-informed staging added.
