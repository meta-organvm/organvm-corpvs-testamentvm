## Artist Statement

**~150 words — copy between the lines:**

---

I build creative systems — the governance IS the artwork.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system — a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. The 42 published essays documenting this process aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time.

I use AI tools as compositional instruments, the way Brian Eno treated the studio. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work. The result: a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, built over 5+ years and 33 development sprints.

## Project Description / Why This Opportunity

---

The eight-organ system is a living creative work — 100 repositories across 8 organizations coordinated through automated governance, a formal promotion state machine, and 42 published essays documenting the process in real time. The governance structures aren't bureaucracy — they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant represents a critical opportunity to sustain and extend this practice. The work is built, documented, and operational — what it needs now is the time and resources to deepen, not to start over.

## Key Differentiators (if asked "what makes you different")

1. Governance as creative medium — registry design, dependency graphs, and promotion pipelines are generative structures.
2. Process-as-product methodology — the 42 essays aren't marketing; they ARE the creative work.
3. Solo production at institutional scale — one person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations.
4. Cross-domain integration — the eight-organ model bridges theory, art, commerce, governance, and community.
