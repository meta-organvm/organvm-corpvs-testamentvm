## B. Canonical Identity Statement

> I am a systems artist and auteur-producer who builds creative systems at institutional scale. The ORGANVM project — 100 repositories coordinated across 8 GitHub organizations through automated governance, dependency validation, and a formal promotion state machine — is simultaneously working infrastructure, a documented creative methodology, and an argument that the process of creation, made visible and governable, is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce. I use AI tools as compositional instruments: the architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work.

**Rules:**
- **Never** say "I am an engineer" or "software engineer" in art/grant contexts — use "systems artist," "creative technologist," or "auteur-producer"
- **Exception:** For job-track applications at AI labs, use "independent engineer" or "systems engineer" framing (see Identity Position #5)
- **Never** frame the system as a portfolio piece for an engineering job in grant contexts — the system IS the creative practice
- The process of creation IS the product — this is the thesis, not a metaphor
- "Solo production at institutional scale" is the method descriptor
- "AI tools as compositional instruments" is the technology descriptor

## C. Canonical Artist Statement

### Long (~300 words)

I design environments where creative organisms grow — and then I document the process of growing them.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 103 repositories. I don't produce individual artworks. I produce the *systems* that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work — and the visible record of how those systems are built is itself the primary creative output.

The process of creation is the product. The 42 essays I've published aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time. The governance rules — registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines — aren't bureaucratic overhead; they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge. Every architectural decision is an artistic decision.

I work in the tradition of solo producers who became orchestras: Brian Eno treating the studio as a compositional instrument rather than a recording space; Trent Reznor building entire albums alone because nobody else would commit at the necessary intensity; Brian Wilson directing session musicians like a film director directs actors, making the album in the assembly. I use AI tools the way these practitioners used their technologies — as instruments for realizing an architectural vision, not as replacements for creative judgment.

My reference points also include Julian Oliver's critical engineering, Nicky Case's Explorable Explanations, and Hundred Rabbits' radical transparency. What connects all of them is the conviction that protocols, governance structures, and systems design are primary creative outputs — not supplementary.

The eight-organ system is simultaneously: (a) working infrastructure that produces creative work, (b) a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, (c) an argument that the process of creation — made visible and governable — is itself the most interesting thing an artist can produce, and (d) a reusable model other practitioners can learn from.

### Medium (~150 words)

I build creative systems — environments where theory, art, and community work grow like organisms in a medium. My eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 organizations through automated governance, dependency validation, and a formal promotion state machine. The 42 published essays documenting this process aren't reflections on the work; they ARE the work — the creative process rendered into prose in real time.

I use AI tools as compositional instruments, the way Brian Eno treated the studio or Hundred Rabbits treat their custom toolchain. The architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are the creative work; AI provides execution capacity. The governance rules aren't bureaucracy — they're generative constraints that shape what the system can become.

The result: a documented methodology for solo production at institutional scale, built over 5+ years and 33 named development sprints, demonstrating that process-as-product is a viable and rigorous creative practice.

### Short (~75 words)

Systems artist building creative infrastructure at institutional scale. My eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 organizations — spanning theory, generative art, commerce, governance, public process, community, and marketing. 42 published essays document the methodology in real time. The process of creation is the product: governance structures, dependency graphs, and promotion pipelines are generative constraints, not bureaucracy. Solo production using AI tools as compositional instruments.

## G. Key Differentiators

1. **Solo production at institutional scale.** One person built and documented a 100-repository system across 8 organizations with automated governance, dependency validation, and a formal promotion state machine — the kind of infrastructure normally requiring a team of 5-10.

2. **Process-as-product methodology.** The 42 essays aren't marketing or documentation — they ARE the creative work. The visible record of building the system, including mistakes and course corrections, is the primary artistic output.

3. **AI-augmented creative practice, not AI-generated art.** AI tools serve as compositional instruments — the architectural vision, governance design, and editorial judgment are human. This is the Eno model applied to software: the studio (AI) is an instrument, not the musician.

4. **Governance as creative medium.** Registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines, and constitutional constraints are treated as generative structures — the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge.

5. **Radical transparency at system scale.** Every decision, sprint, failure, and course correction is documented and published. ~404K+ words, 33 sprint specs, 12 ADRs, a constitution with amendments — the entire institutional memory is public.

6. **Cross-domain integration.** The eight-organ model bridges theory, art, commerce, governance, public process, community, and marketing in a single coordinated system. Most practitioners work in one domain; this system treats the boundaries between domains as the most interesting sites for creative work.

## J. What NOT to Claim

Honest gap list — do not overstate in any application:

| Gap | Reality | How to Frame |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| No production users | Beta not yet deployed. 291 tests pass, DB provisioned, but 0 live users | "Feature-complete, preparing for beta deployment" |
| No collaborative team engineering | All 5 years solo. No code review with peers, no shared codebases | "Independent engineering practice" (don't claim team experience) |
| No published book | 42 essays (~404K+ words) but no book | "Sustained nonfiction practice" or "book-length corpus" |
| No gallery exhibitions | Portfolio site and generative art, but no gallery shows | "Digital exhibition" via portfolio site |
| No institutional affiliation | Adjunct instructor, no full-time academic position | "Independent practitioner" (many grants prefer this) |
| Limited ML knowledge | Uses LLM APIs, doesn't train or fine-tune models | "AI orchestration" not "ML engineering" |
| No enterprise customer-facing tech | Teaching IS customer-facing, but not enterprise tech support | Frame teaching experience, not enterprise experience |

## Usage Guide

1. **Before any application:** Read sections A (metrics) and B (identity) to ensure consistency
2. **For artist statements:** Copy from section C at appropriate length
3. **For bios:** Copy from section D at appropriate length
4. **For work samples:** Use section E ordering (highest impact first)
5. **For form fields asking for links:** Copy from section F
6. **For "what makes you different" questions:** Draw from section G
7. **For framing choices:** Consult section H for the right identity position
8. **For evidence claims:** Verify against section I before stating
9. **For honesty checks:** Review section J before submitting — never claim what isn't there
10. **For automated generation:** Run `python3 scripts/alchemizer.py` — reads this file as source of truth

### Alchemizer Integration

All 43 targets have JSON identity profiles in `docs/applications/profiles/`. 38 non-consulting targets have submission scripts in `docs/applications/submission-scripts/`. Generated by `scripts/alchemizer.py`, which reads this covenant-ark for canonical metrics, maps each target to one of four identity positions (Section H), and produces position-shifted artist statements, bios, evidence ordering, and submission scripts.

To regenerate after updating metrics: `python3 scripts/alchemizer.py`
To audit coverage: `python3 scripts/alchemizer.py --audit`
To generate for a single target: `python3 scripts/alchemizer.py --target creative-capital`
