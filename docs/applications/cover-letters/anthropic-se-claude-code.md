I'm applying for the Software Engineer position on the Claude Code team. I build developer tools that make complex systems navigable — and I've been doing it at a scale that tests every architectural assumption.

## Why Claude Code

I'm excited about AI-assisted coding as a tool to enhance developer productivity because I've experienced firsthand what happens when systems grow beyond what any single person can hold in their head. The eight-organ system I designed coordinates 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations. Without strong tooling — a machine-readable registry, automated health checks, dependency validation — that system would be unmanageable. I built those tools because I needed them. Claude Code is building them for everyone.

## What I'd Bring

**Developer tools shaped by real need.** orchestration-start-here is the entry point to a 97-repo system. It exists because I discovered that without a clear "start here" experience, even well-documented systems are impenetrable. Every design choice — the reading order, the cross-document dependency map, the annotated manifest — came from watching people get lost and building something better. That's the developer experience instinct your team needs.

**LLM orchestration patterns in production.** agentic-titan implements multi-agent orchestration across 18 development phases with 1,095 tests. I've worked with chaining patterns, tool-use, and coordination across agent boundaries. linguistic-atomization-framework breaks language into composable units — the kind of DSL design thinking that matters when building tools that parse and transform code. The eight-organ system itself was built using an AI-conductor workflow model where AI generates volume and human reviews — I've been in the loop of LLM-assisted development for the entire project.

**Full-stack capacity with safety instincts.** The system enforces constitutional constraints: no back-edges in the dependency graph, promotion through a formal state machine, transitive depth limits. These are safety constraints at the infrastructure level — the same thinking that matters in AI-assisted coding tools. I've built compliance into the architecture, not bolted it on after.

**Container and CLI experience.** 5 GitHub Actions workflows automate validation across the entire system. organ-audit.py runs health checks across 97 repos. I've worked with containerized environments, CI/CD pipelines, and command-line tooling at production scale.

## Evidence

- **agentic-titan:** 1,095 tests, multi-agent orchestration (organvm-iv-taxis/agentic-titan)
- **recursive-engine:** 1,254 tests, 85% coverage, symbolic DSL design (organvm-i-theoria/recursive-engine--generative-entity)
- **linguistic-atomization-framework:** Language decomposition and composable DSL design (organvm-i-theoria/linguistic-atomization-framework)
- **organvm-corpvs-testamentvm:** Meta-system architecture and tooling documentation (meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm)
- **Portfolio:** https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/

The eight-organ system exists because I believe autonomous creative systems need the same governance rigor as production AI tools — and that building infrastructure transparently makes it better.
