I'm applying for the Lead DX Engineer, Documentation role at Together AI. I've written 335,000 words of portfolio-quality documentation for a system coordinating 81 repositories across 8 organizations — and I did it because I believe documentation is infrastructure, not decoration.

## Why Together AI

Together AI is building the infrastructure layer for open-source AI. That infrastructure is only as useful as its documentation. I want to be the person who makes sure every developer who touches Together's APIs has the experience of something clicking — the guide that anticipated their question, the cookbook that solved their exact use case, the reference that didn't make them guess.

## What I'd Bring

**Documentation at scale, built from scratch.** The eight-organ system has:
- 73 documented repositories, each with a README written for external evaluators
- A reading order and cross-document dependency map so newcomers know where to start
- An annotated manifest providing per-file descriptions of every document in the corpus
- 20 meta-system essays explaining architectural decisions to non-technical audiences

This wasn't a documentation pass on existing code. It was documentation-first development: the docs defined what the system would become.

**LLM and AI application experience.** agentic-titan is a multi-agent orchestration framework with 1,095 tests. recursive-engine implements a symbolic operating system with a custom DSL, 21 organ handlers, and 1,254 tests. metasystem-master coordinates these subsystems at the meta-level — the kind of architecture documentation that teaches by showing how pieces compose. I understand LLM APIs — tool-use, chaining, structured outputs, function calling — because I've built production systems that depend on them.

**Code examples in Python and TypeScript.** The system includes:
- Python validation scripts (organ-audit.py, platinum-validation.py)
- YAML workflow specifications for 5 GitHub Actions
- JSON schemas (registry-v2.json, governance-rules.json, organvm.config.json)
- Shell scripts for environment configuration

I write code that teaches. Every script is documented with the "why," not just the "what."

**Founding-team energy.** This is a founding documentation role. I've built documentation systems from zero before — the entire eight-organ documentation corpus was designed, structured, and shipped in a single sprint. I know how to set standards, build templates, and create processes that scale.

## Evidence

- **organvm-corpvs-testamentvm:** The documentation corpus itself — 335K words of structured technical writing (meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm)
- **metasystem-master:** Meta-level architecture documentation showing system composition (organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master)
- **my-knowledge-base:** Knowledge management system design (organvm-i-theoria/my-knowledge-base)
- **narratological-algorithmic-lenses:** Analytical writing applied to computational systems (organvm-i-theoria/narratological-algorithmic-lenses)
- **Portfolio:** https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/

Documentation is infrastructure. I want to build Together AI's.
