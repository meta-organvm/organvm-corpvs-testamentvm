The eight-organ system coordinates 97 repositories across 8 organizations — half generative art, interactive narrative, and experiential design; half the governance, orchestration, and tooling infrastructure that makes the creative work possible at scale. metasystem-master serves as the internal tooling layer that makes the whole system navigable. I built both because creative systems need the same engineering rigor as production platforms. That's Runway's thesis, and why I'm applying for the MTS, Research Tooling & Data Platform role.

## Why Runway

Runway's research teams need internal tooling built by someone who understands what researchers need and how to build platforms that don't get in their way. The eight-organ system required solving that problem: generative art repos need different workflows than governance infrastructure, but they share a registry, a dependency model, and a promotion pipeline. Every design choice in the tooling layer came from watching creative work get blocked by bad infrastructure — and building something better.

## What I'd Bring

**Platform engineering with creative empathy.** metasystem-master coordinates subsystems at the meta-level — it's the internal tooling layer that makes the eight-organ system navigable for contributors who aren't me. Every design choice prioritizes user experience: clean interfaces, clear documentation, predictable behavior. "User empathy in infrastructure roles" is exactly how I'd describe my approach.

**Symbolic systems and generative architecture.** recursive-engine--generative-entity implements a symbolic operating system with a custom DSL, 21 organ handlers, and 1,254 tests at 85% coverage. I've built the kind of systems Runway's researchers work with: generative pipelines, symbolic representations, model evaluation harnesses. I understand the data structures and orchestration patterns behind creative AI.

**Product engineering across domains.** classroom-rpg-aetheria is an educational RPG system — game mechanics, narrative branching, state management — built as a complete product. your-fit-tailored is a personalization and recommendation system. These aren't side projects; they're full-stack products that demonstrate the TypeScript/React product engineering and UX design your job description values alongside infrastructure work.

**Self-directed, pragmatic execution.** I shipped the entire eight-organ system — 404K+ words of documentation, 82+ CI/CD pipelines, 5 governance workflows, a machine-readable registry — in a single concentrated sprint. I don't need a roadmap to know what to build next. I look at what researchers are struggling with, and I build the tool that fixes it.

- **recursive-engine:** 1,254 tests, symbolic OS, generative pipeline design (organvm-i-theoria/recursive-engine--generative-entity)
- **classroom-rpg-aetheria:** Full-stack educational RPG — game mechanics, narrative, state management (organvm-iii-ergon/classroom-rpg-aetheria)

I build infrastructure that creative people actually want to use. I'd like to do that for Runway's research teams.
