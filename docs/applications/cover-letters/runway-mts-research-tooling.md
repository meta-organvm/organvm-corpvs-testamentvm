I'm applying for the MTS, Research Tooling & Data Platform role at Runway. I'm an artist-engineer — someone who builds production infrastructure with the same care for user experience that you'd expect from a creative tool. Runway's mission of merging art and technology isn't aspirational for me; it's how I've been working.

## Why Runway

The eight-organ system I designed is a creative-institutional architecture: 81 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, half of which are generative art, interactive narrative, and experiential design projects. The other half is the governance, orchestration, and tooling infrastructure that makes the creative work possible at scale. I didn't build art tools OR infrastructure — I built both, because I believe creative systems deserve the same engineering rigor as production platforms.

Runway is doing the same thing at a much larger scale. Your research teams need internal tooling built by someone who understands both what researchers need and how to build platforms that don't get in their way. That's the intersection I work at.

## What I'd Bring

**Platform engineering with creative empathy.** metasystem-master coordinates subsystems at the meta-level — it's the internal tooling layer that makes the eight-organ system navigable for contributors who aren't me. Every design choice prioritizes user experience: clean interfaces, clear documentation, predictable behavior. "User empathy in infrastructure roles" is exactly how I'd describe my approach.

**Symbolic systems and generative architecture.** recursive-engine--generative-entity implements a symbolic operating system with a custom DSL, 21 organ handlers, and 1,254 tests at 85% coverage. I've built the kind of systems Runway's researchers work with: generative pipelines, symbolic representations, model evaluation harnesses. I understand the data structures and orchestration patterns behind creative AI.

**Product engineering across domains.** classroom-rpg-aetheria is an educational RPG system — game mechanics, narrative branching, state management — built as a complete product. your-fit-tailored is a personalization and recommendation system. These aren't side projects; they're full-stack products that demonstrate the TypeScript/React product engineering and UX design your job description values alongside infrastructure work.

**Self-directed, pragmatic execution.** I shipped the entire eight-organ system — 320K words of documentation, 65+ CI/CD pipelines, 5 governance workflows, a machine-readable registry — in a single concentrated sprint. I don't need a roadmap to know what to build next. I look at what researchers are struggling with, and I build the tool that fixes it.

## Evidence

- **metasystem-master:** Creative systems architecture and internal tooling (organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master)
- **recursive-engine:** 1,254 tests, symbolic OS, generative pipeline design (organvm-i-theoria/recursive-engine--generative-entity)
- **classroom-rpg-aetheria:** Full-stack educational RPG — game mechanics, narrative, state management (organvm-iii-ergon/classroom-rpg-aetheria)
- **your-fit-tailored:** Personalization and recommendation product engineering (organvm-iii-ergon/your-fit-tailored)
- **Portfolio:** https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/

I build infrastructure that creative people actually want to use. I'd like to do that for Runway's research teams.
