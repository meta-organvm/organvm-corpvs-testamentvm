# Cover Letter: Anthropic — Forward Deployed Engineer, Custom Agents

**Role:** Forward Deployed Engineer, Custom Agents
**Apply:** https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/5074695008
**Salary:** $280,000–$400,000

---

The eight-organ system I built enforces governance rules as data: a machine-readable registry serves as single source of truth for 100 repositories, a dependency validator blocks merges that violate constitutional constraints, and automated audits have maintained 0 critical alerts since launch. That approach — constraints encoded in data, enforced by automation, not by human vigilance — is why I'm drawn to the Forward Deployed Engineer, Custom Agents role at Anthropic.

## Why Anthropic

Anthropic's approach to AI safety requires constraints that scale — not constraints that erode under pressure. The system I described above solves the same problem at infrastructure scale: governance-rules.json encodes constitutional principles, and automated checks enforce them on every merge without human vigilance. The dependency validator blocks violations before they reach production. Monthly audits confirm system health. The constraints hold because they're structural, not procedural.

## What I'd Bring to the FDE Team

**Agent development, tested rigorously.** agentic-titan is a multi-agent orchestration framework I built through 18 development phases with 1,095 tests covering agent coordination, message passing, and fault tolerance. a-i-council--coliseum implements multi-agent deliberation — AI agents debating and synthesizing positions — which is exactly the kind of custom agent workflow your enterprise clients need. I understand what it takes to make agent systems reliable in production — phased development, comprehensive testing, clear architectural boundaries.

**Deployment patterns I've already codified.** Your FDE team identifies repeatable deployment patterns and feeds them back to Product and Engineering. I've done this systematically: governance-rules.json encodes rules the system enforces automatically; orchestration-system-v2.md documents the rationale behind every architectural decision; 5 GitHub Actions workflows automate health checks, dependency validation, and promotion across the entire system. These are the kind of artifacts — MCP servers, sub-agents, agent skills — your job description calls for.

**Communication capacity for enterprise environments.** The system includes 404,000+ words of documentation written for grant reviewers and hiring managers, not just developers. I can explain complex orchestration systems to non-technical stakeholders and translate their needs into production implementations.

**Autonomy under ambiguity.** The eight-organ system didn't start with a spec — it started with a question about how to organize 101 repositories into a coherent creative-institutional system. I defined the architecture, built the tooling, documented the decisions, and shipped it. That's the FDE operating model.

## Evidence

- **agentic-titan:** 1,095 tests, 18 phases, multi-agent orchestration (organvm-iv-taxis/agentic-titan)
- **a-i-council--coliseum:** Multi-agent deliberation system — AI agents debating and synthesizing (organvm-ii-poiesis/a-i-council--coliseum)
- **organvm-corpvs-testamentvm:** The governance corpus itself — ~404K+ words of constitutional architecture (meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm)
- **narratological-algorithmic-lenses:** Analytical frameworks applied to narrative systems (organvm-i-theoria/narratological-algorithmic-lenses)
- **Portfolio:** https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how governance-first design applies to deploying Claude in regulated enterprise environments.
