**Salary:** $280,000–$400,000

I'm applying for the Forward Deployed Engineer, Custom Agents role at Anthropic. My background is in building autonomous systems with production-grade governance — I'm an artist-engineer who treats orchestration and constraint enforcement as primary outputs, not afterthoughts.

## Why Anthropic

I care about governance-as-safety because I've built it. The eight-organ system I designed coordinates 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations, and its core innovation is that governance rules are data, not code. A machine-readable registry serves as single source of truth. A dependency validator enforces no circular dependencies and no back-edges. A constitutional document defines immutable principles that automated checks enforce on every merge. This isn't theoretical — it's deployed, audited monthly, and has maintained 0 critical alerts since launch.

That's the same discipline Anthropic brings to AI safety: constraints that scale, not constraints that erode under pressure.

## What I'd Bring to the FDE Team

**Agent development, tested rigorously.** agentic-titan is a multi-agent orchestration framework I built through 18 development phases with 1,095 tests covering agent coordination, message passing, and fault tolerance. a-i-council--coliseum implements multi-agent deliberation — AI agents debating and synthesizing positions — which is exactly the kind of custom agent workflow your enterprise clients need. I understand what it takes to make agent systems reliable in production — phased development, comprehensive testing, clear architectural boundaries.

**Deployment patterns I've already codified.** Your FDE team identifies repeatable deployment patterns and feeds them back to Product and Engineering. I've done this systematically: governance-rules.json encodes rules the system enforces automatically; orchestration-system-v2.md documents the rationale behind every architectural decision; 5 GitHub Actions workflows automate health checks, dependency validation, and promotion across the entire system. These are the kind of artifacts — MCP servers, sub-agents, agent skills — your job description calls for.

**Communication capacity for enterprise environments.** The system includes 386,000+ words of documentation written for grant reviewers and hiring managers, not just developers. I can explain complex orchestration systems to non-technical stakeholders and translate their needs into production implementations.

**Autonomy under ambiguity.** The eight-organ system didn't start with a spec — it started with a question about how to organize 97 repositories into a coherent creative-institutional system. I defined the architecture, built the tooling, documented the decisions, and shipped it. That's the FDE operating model.

## Evidence

- **agentic-titan:** 1,095 tests, 18 phases, multi-agent orchestration (organvm-iv-taxis/agentic-titan)
- **a-i-council--coliseum:** Multi-agent deliberation system — AI agents debating and synthesizing (organvm-ii-poiesis/a-i-council--coliseum)
- **organvm-corpvs-testamentvm:** The governance corpus itself — ~386K+ words of constitutional architecture (meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm)
- **narratological-algorithmic-lenses:** Analytical frameworks applied to narrative systems (organvm-i-theoria/narratological-algorithmic-lenses)
- **Portfolio:** https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how governance-first design applies to deploying Claude in regulated enterprise environments.
