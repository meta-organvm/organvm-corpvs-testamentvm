## Fit Assessment — 7/10

**Why it fits:** The AMT Lab explicitly funds "bold ideas in the performing arts that engage digital tools, innovative data practices and emerging production methods." The organ system's governance-as-score methodology, AI orchestration as conducting, and community salon infrastructure (ORGAN-VI) map directly to performing arts + technology.

**Gap to address:** The organ system is not primarily a performing arts practice — it's systems art. The proposal must frame the work as *creating new performance formats* using the governance infrastructure, not as software development. The performing arts framing from the Watermill proposal (dependency rules as choreographic constraints) applies here too, but with more emphasis on the technology innovation angle.

**Key phrase from their announcement:** "fueling new creative experiments and applied technological research led by the arts."

Governance as Performance Score: An AI-Orchestrated Framework for Collaborative Performing Arts Production

## Project Summary / Abstract

**~250 words — adjust to field limits:**

---

This project develops a performance-making framework that translates software governance protocols into live performance scores — proving that the same formal rules that coordinate 97 software repositories can generate, structure, and sustain collaborative performing arts work.

The eight-organ creative-institutional system is a documented infrastructure I've built over 5+ years, coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public documentation, community programming, and distribution across 97 repositories and 8 organizations. The system's governance model — dependency validation, promotion state machines, automated coordination workflows — currently operates as software infrastructure. This project asks: what happens when those rules become choreographic?

The proposed six-month rapid prototyping period will produce three interconnected outputs:

1. **Performance Score Engine** — A software tool that translates the organ system's governance rules (dependency graphs, no-back-edge constraints, promotion protocols) into structured improvisation scores for live performers. The rules that currently coordinate code repositories become the rules that coordinate bodies, voices, and media in real time.

2. **Three Proof-of-Performance Works** — Staged readings / workshop performances testing the score engine with dancers, musicians, and theater artists. Each performance uses a different governance rule as its primary constraint.

3. **Open-Source Documentation** — The performance score engine, the governance-to-choreography translation methodology, and all three performance scores published as open-source tools other performing artists can adapt. Consistent with the project's existing practice of radical transparency (42 published essays, 404,000+ words of public documentation).

The project bridges AI-augmented systems design and live performance, creating reusable tools for performing artists to engage with governance structures as creative material.

## Performing Arts Connection Statement

If the form asks how this connects to performing arts specifically:

---

This project creates new performance formats — not new software. The technology serves the art.

The core innovation is translating formal governance protocols (dependency graphs, state machines, no-back-edge constraints) into live performance scores. These are the same kinds of formal rules that have generated musical compositions (Bach's counterpoint rules, Cage's chance operations, Eno's Oblique Strategies) — but operating at the architectural level, governing how entire creative systems interact rather than how individual notes relate.

The performing arts connection is direct: the dependency rule that prevents ORGAN-III (Commerce) from depending on ORGAN-II (Art) becomes a movement rule that prevents one group of performers from receiving material from another. The promotion state machine (LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC_PROCESS → GRADUATED) becomes a dramaturgical arc. The automated audit workflows become moments of collective reflection in rehearsal.

My practice already includes community salon programming (ORGAN-VI) and public performance of documentation (ORGAN-V essay readings). The AMT Lab would resource the next step: formal performance works using the governance infrastructure as compositional material, developed with performing artists across dance, theater, and interdisciplinary practice.

## Artist Bio / CV

**~200 words:**

---

Systems artist, writer, and creative technologist based in NYC. MFA in Creative Writing (Florida Atlantic University, 2015–2018). 11 years teaching at 8+ institutions, 100+ courses, 2,000+ students. LGBTQ+.

Creator of the eight-organ creative-institutional system: 97 repositories across 8 organizations, coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing as a unified practice. 42 published essays (~134,000 words) documenting the construction process in real time. 404,000+ words of total public documentation. 82+ CI/CD automation pipelines. 33 named development sprints. All produced by a single practitioner using AI as a compositional instrument — analogous to a conductor directing an orchestra, where the creative intelligence is in the architecture, sequencing, and editorial judgment.

Performance-adjacent practice includes: community salon programming (ORGAN-VI), public readings and presentations of documentation, generative audio-visual installations using p5.js and SuperCollider, and the ongoing public process essay series (distributed via RSS, Mastodon, and Discord). The organ system's governance model was designed using principles from musical composition (generative constraints, counterpoint rules, serialist methods) — the AMT Lab would make this implicit performing-arts methodology explicit.

18 years of professional experience across construction, education, multimedia production, and software.

## Work Samples / Supporting Materials

### Sample 1: Portfolio Site with Generative Performance Layer

**URL:** `https://4444j99.github.io/portfolio/`

Every page includes a generative p5.js visual layer — procedural compositions that respond to page context. The site demonstrates the visual-performative dimension of the practice: code generating real-time output that changes with each viewing.

### Sample 2: Eight-Organ System Architecture

**URL:** `https://github.com/meta-organvm`

The governance architecture that would become the performance score material. 97 repositories, 31 dependency edges, promotion state machines, automated validation — all documented transparently.

### Sample 3: Public Process Essay Series

**URL:** `https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/`

42 published essays documenting the system's construction in real time. The documentation practice IS a performance — the act of public writing as live creative output.

### Sample 4: Generative Art and Audio Framework

**URL:** `https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master`

Generative visual and sonic output built with p5.js, SuperCollider, and Pure Data. This demonstrates the performance medium: the same tools that generate visual art can generate live performance material.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **Form asks for organizational fiscal sponsor:** You are applying as an individual, not an organization. If the form requires a fiscal sponsor, use Fractured Atlas (if F2 has been completed) or note "individual applicant — fiscal sponsorship available through Fractured Atlas upon request."
- **"Performing arts" feels like a stretch:** Lead with the community salon programming (ORGAN-VI), the public essay readings, and the generative audio-visual installations. These ARE performing arts practices. The proposal extends them into formal performance works.
- **Budget is too high:** Scale down: $75K version drops collaborator fees to $15K (3-4 artists), space rental to $8K, and stipend to $32K. $50K version: $25K stipend, $10K collaborators, $8K technology, $7K other.
- **Word limits tighter than expected:** Trim the performing arts connection statement first. The project summary carries the core argument.
- **They ask about technology innovation specifically:** The governance-to-performance-score translation IS the technology innovation. No existing tool converts formal software governance rules into live performance scores. This is genuinely novel.
- **They ask about performing arts credentials:** MFA, 11 years teaching (including performance-adjacent pedagogy), community salon programming, public readings, generative audio-visual installations. You are not a dancer or a theater director — you are a systems artist proposing to create tools FOR performers, in collaboration with performers.
