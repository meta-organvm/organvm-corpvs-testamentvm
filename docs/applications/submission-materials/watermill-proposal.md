## The Proposal

I propose to develop *Governance as Performance* — a series of installations and performance works that make the invisible architecture of creative systems visible, audible, and participatory.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating 100 software repositories across 8 organizations through formal governance rules — dependency graphs, promotion state machines, automated validation workflows. I've built this system over 5+ years, producing 42 published essays and 404,000+ words of documentation along the way. The governance model — the rules that decide how work flows between theory, art, commerce, and community — is itself the primary artistic output.

At Watermill, I want to translate this invisible architecture into collaborative performance.

## Three Proposed Works

### 1. The Conductor's Score (Installation)

A real-time visualization of the eight-organ system's dependency graph projected onto a wall-sized surface. Each of the 100 repositories appears as a node; the 31 validated dependency edges glow as data flows between them. The system's actual GitHub activity — commits, issues, workflow runs — drives the visualization in real time. Visitors can trigger events (opening issues, requesting promotions) that ripple through the graph. The installation makes governance *visible* — the audience sees an institutional structure operating as a living organism.

### 2. The Orchestration (Collaborative Performance)

A structured improvisation for 6-12 performers, using the eight-organ system's governance rules as a performance score. Each performer represents one organ (Theory, Art, Commerce, Governance, Public Process, Community, Marketing, Meta). The dependency rules become movement rules: ORGAN-I (Theory) can pass material to ORGAN-II (Art), but ORGAN-II cannot pass material back. The no-back-edges constraint that governs the software system becomes a choreographic constraint that shapes what movements, sounds, and gestures can flow between performers. Robert Wilson's formal compositional methodology — treating time, space, and structure as equal elements — is the natural context for this work.

### 3. The Public Process (Documentation-as-Performance)

Daily documentation of the residency itself, written and published in real time as new entries in the ongoing essay series. The act of documenting becomes part of the residency's performative output — not a reflection on the experience but an extension of it. These essays will be published to the 42-essay public archive, making the Watermill experience part of the system's permanent record. The audience for these texts extends beyond Watermill to the growing readership of the public process series.

## Why Watermill

Robert Wilson treats performance as architecture — time, space, light, and structure composed with the same rigor as a building. My practice treats software architecture as performance — governance rules, data flows, and coordination protocols composed with the same intention as a score. The Watermill Center's commitment to experimental, collaborative, interdisciplinary work is the ideal context for translating digital governance into embodied practice.

The collaborative environment — 60-100 artists from 30+ countries — offers something my solo practice specifically lacks: other bodies in the room. The organ system was built by one person using AI as a compositional instrument. Watermill would be the first time the system's governance rules are tested as collaborative performance scores with real performers, not automated agents.
