# Artist Statement — Watermill Center Summer Program 2026

## Artist Statement (~200 words)

I design environments where creative organisms grow — and then I document the process of growing them.

My practice centers on the eight-organ system: a documented infrastructure coordinating theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing across 100 repositories and 8 GitHub organizations. I don't produce individual artworks. I produce the systems that generate, coordinate, and sustain creative work — and the visible record of how those systems are built is itself the primary creative output.

The governance rules — registry design, dependency graphs, promotion pipelines — aren't bureaucratic overhead; they're generative constraints, the way a composer's harmonic rules shape what melodies can emerge. Every architectural decision is an artistic decision.

I work in the tradition of solo producers who became orchestras: Brian Eno treating the studio as a compositional instrument, Trent Reznor building alone because nobody else would commit at the necessary intensity. I use AI tools the way these practitioners used their technologies — as instruments for realizing an architectural vision, not as replacements for creative judgment.

At Watermill, I want to translate the system's invisible governance into visible, collaborative performance — using the dependency rules as choreographic scores.
