# Track: Grant Funding

**Targets:** Knight Foundation Art+Tech, Mellon Foundation Arts & Culture, NEA Grants for Arts Projects
**Identity:** Artist-engineer building autonomous creative infrastructure with documented governance
**Core evidence:** ORGAN-V essays + registry + eight-organ organizational model

---

## Framing

"This demonstrates long-term digital capacity. The eight-organ model isn't a project — it's infrastructure that enables ongoing creative work."

Grant reviewers evaluate:
1. **Organizational capacity** — Can you execute sustained work? (Registry + 97 repos = yes)
2. **Long-term sustainability** — Will this outlast the grant period? (Automated governance = yes)
3. **Community contribution** — Does this benefit others? (Public documentation + ORGAN-VI = yes)
4. **Innovation** — Is this genuinely new? (Governance-as-artistic-medium = yes)
5. **Demonstrated track record** — Have you shipped before? (~386K+ words deployed, 82+ CI/CD = yes)

## Target-Specific Angles

### Knight Foundation — Art+Tech Expansion Fund

**What they fund:** Long-term capacity for arts organizations using technology. Infrastructure, not projects.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system IS long-term infrastructure. It's not a single artwork or product — it's a documented, automated system for producing creative work indefinitely.

**Key evidence:**
- Registry-v2.json: Machine-readable infrastructure for 97 repos
- 5 GitHub Actions workflows: Autonomous governance that runs without human intervention
- Monthly audit: Automated health checks ensure system remains coherent
- ORGAN-V essays: Public documentation of the entire model

**Narrative angle:**
"The eight-organ system is creative infrastructure at institutional scale — operated by a single artist-engineer but designed with the governance rigor of an organization. This isn't a project request; it's evidence that the infrastructure already exists and is operational. The grant would fund sustained content production (ORGAN-V essays), community programming (ORGAN-VI), and implementation of the highest-priority SKELETON repos into working systems."

**Budget methodology:**
- Content production: 5 essays/month x TE cost per essay (~120K TE each) = mapped to API costs
- Infrastructure maintenance: Monthly audit + ad-hoc fixes
- Community programming: ORGAN-VI salon series, reading groups
- Implementation sprints: 3-5 SKELETON -> PROTOTYPE elevations per quarter

### Mellon Foundation — Arts & Culture

**What they fund:** Arts organizations demonstrating holistic approaches to culture and organizational sustainability.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ model IS a holistic organizational model. Theory, Art, Commerce, Governance, Public Process, Community, Marketing — all coordinated as one system.

**Key evidence:**
- All 8 organs operational simultaneously — not sequential, not siloed
- Cross-organ dependency model: I->II->III with formal validation
- ORGAN-VI community infrastructure: collaborative spaces, governance
- State machine: formal lifecycle management for creative work

**Narrative angle:**
"The eight-organ creative-institutional system demonstrates that a single practitioner can operate at organizational scale through documented governance and automated coordination. Each organ addresses a distinct institutional function — theory, production, commerce, governance, transparency, community, distribution — creating a complete creative ecosystem. The Mellon Foundation's commitment to holistic arts practice aligns with this model's core premise: that sustainable creative work requires institutional infrastructure, not just artistic talent."

### NEA — Grants for Arts Projects

**What they fund:** Specific art projects, $10K-$50K. Smaller scope, more concrete deliverables.

**Why you fit:** Focus on a single ORGAN-II project as the proposal, with the eight-organ system as organizational context.

**Proposed project:** Interactive generative installation (ORGAN-II) drawing from recursive-engine theory (ORGAN-I), documented publicly (ORGAN-V), with community engagement (ORGAN-VI).

**Key evidence:**
- ORGAN-II repos: example-interactive-installation, metasystem-master
- ORGAN-I theoretical foundation: recursive-engine, narratological-algorithmic-lenses
- Documented process: ORGAN-V essays about the artistic methodology

**Narrative angle:**
"This project creates an interactive generative installation that translates recursive epistemological frameworks (ORGAN-I: Theoria) into embodied artistic experience. The work exists within a larger eight-organ creative infrastructure that provides governance, documentation, and community support — ensuring the project has institutional backing for long-term sustainability."

## LOI Template (Letter of Inquiry)

> **Project Title:** [SPECIFIC OR GENERAL]
>
> **Applicant:** [NAME] — artist-engineer building autonomous creative systems
>
> **Summary:**
> [1-2 sentences describing the specific request]
>
> **Background:**
> Over the past five years, I have developed an eight-organ creative-institutional system that coordinates 97 repositories across theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing. The system includes automated governance (5 GitHub Actions workflows), a machine-readable registry, formal dependency validation, and ~386,000+ words of public documentation. All eight organs are currently operational.
>
> **What This Grant Would Fund:**
> [Specific deliverables — essays, implementations, community programming, installations]
>
> **Why This Matters:**
> The eight-organ model demonstrates that sustainable creative practice requires institutional infrastructure — not just talent. By treating governance as an artistic medium and documenting the entire system publicly, this work contributes reusable patterns for other artist-engineers, small arts organizations, and creative technologists operating at the intersection of art and systems design.
>
> **Evidence of Capacity:**
> - 97 repositories across 8 organizations, all operational
> - 82+ CI/CD pipelines, 5 governance workflows, automated monthly audits
> - 35 published essays (~386K+ words)
> - Flagship projects with >1,000 tests each
> - Complete documentation at portfolio quality (~386K+ words)
>
> **Budget:** [AMOUNT]
> **Timeline:** [DURATION]
> **Portfolio:** github.com/meta-organvm

## Budget Framework (TE-to-Cost Translation)

For grants that require dollar budgets, translate the TE model:

| Activity | TE Budget | Approx. API Cost* | Calendar |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Essay production (5/month) | ~600K TE/month | ~$60/month | Ongoing |
| Implementation sprint (3-5 repos) | ~500K TE | ~$50 | Per quarter |
| Monthly audit + maintenance | ~50K TE/month | ~$5/month | Ongoing |
| Community programming | Manual | ~$0 (time) | Weekly |
| Infrastructure (hosting, domains) | N/A | ~$20/month | Ongoing |

*Based on approximate Claude API pricing at scale. Actual costs vary.

**For grants >$10K:** Include hardware, travel, exhibition costs, community honoraria on top of the infrastructure costs above. The TE model covers content production; the grant covers everything else.

## Key Differentiators for Grant Reviewers

1. **The infrastructure already exists.** You're not proposing to build something — you're showing what you've built and requesting support to sustain and expand it.

2. **Automated governance at solo-practitioner scale.** Monthly audits run automatically. Dependency validation happens on every PR. Health checks monitor all 97 repos.

3. **Public documentation as evidence.** Grant reviewers can verify every claim by visiting the public repos. The registry, governance rules, and audit reports are all visible.

4. **Artist-engineer hybrid practice.** This isn't purely technical infrastructure or purely artistic output — it's both simultaneously. The governance model IS the artwork.

5. **Sustained practice, not a one-time project.** The eight-organ system has been developing for 5+ years. The grant would fund the next phase of an ongoing practice, not a speculative new idea.
