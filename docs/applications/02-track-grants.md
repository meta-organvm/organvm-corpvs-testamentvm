## Framing

"This demonstrates long-term digital capacity. The eight-organ model isn't a project — it's infrastructure that enables ongoing creative work."

Grant reviewers evaluate:
1. **Organizational capacity** — Can you execute sustained work? (Registry + 97 repos = yes)
2. **Long-term sustainability** — Will this outlast the grant period? (Automated governance = yes)
3. **Community contribution** — Does this benefit others? (Public documentation + ORGAN-VI = yes)
4. **Innovation** — Is this genuinely new? (Governance-as-artistic-medium = yes)
5. **Demonstrated track record** — Have you shipped before? (~404K+ words deployed, 82+ CI/CD = yes)

## Target-Specific Angles

### Creative Capital 2027 Open Call — **HIGHEST FIT (9/10)**

**What they fund:** "Formally and/or conceptually innovative works" by individual artists. Up to $50,000 unrestricted + professional development. Technology is an explicit sub-discipline.

**Why you fit:** The eight-organ system IS a formally innovative creative work. 5+ years of sustained practice. The "process of creation IS the product" thesis is genuinely novel. 41 essays document the practice in real-time.

**Key evidence:**
- 97-repo system as living creative work, not a portfolio piece
- 33 named development sprints demonstrating sustained commitment
- Automated governance: the rules that coordinate 97 repos are as carefully designed as any artwork
- Public process methodology: building in public as creative practice

**Application format:** 6 short questions, 500-word project description, work samples, bio, resume. Panelist advice: "Describe your project with the clarity of a children's book."

**Narrative angle:**
"The eight-organ system is a living creative work that treats governance as an artistic medium. The 97 repositories are not code projects — they are the medium through which theory, art, commerce, and community are orchestrated by a single practitioner at institutional scale. The 41 essays documenting this process in real-time are not supplements to the work — they ARE the work. Creative Capital would fund the next phase of a practice that already demonstrates the capacity, innovation, and sustainability that grant reviewers look for."

**Benefits cliff:** $50K would exceed Medicaid threshold → Essential Plan ($0 premium). Call NYLAG before accepting.

### Artadia NYC Awards — **HIGH FIT (8/10)**

**What they fund:** Unrestricted $15,000 grants for NYC-based contemporary visual artists. 3 awardees per cycle. Free to apply, open-call via Submittable.

**Why you fit:** MFA provides creative credibility. NYC-based. The eight-organ system as artistic practice, with generative art (p5.js), portfolio site, and interactive installations as visual output.

**Key evidence:**
- Portfolio site with generative art (p5.js on all pages, Jost+CMYK design)
- ORGAN-II generative art repos (metasystem-master, interactive installations)
- 41 published essays as evidence of sustained practice
- MFA Creative Writing (FAU, 2015-2018) — creative terminal degree

**Narrative angle:**
"My practice centers on building creative systems — environments where creative organisms grow through documented governance and AI-augmented production. The eight-organ system coordinates 97 repositories through governance structures designed the way a composer designs generative scores: the constraints shape what emerges."

**Benefits cliff:** SNAP-safe (lump sum excluded). $15K on $12K base stays below Medicaid with Schedule C deductions.

### Spencer Foundation Small Research — **MODERATE FIT (6/10)**

**What they fund:** Education research grants up to $50,000. Focus on improving education practice.

**Why you fit (Educator identity):** 11 years teaching at 8+ institutions, 100+ courses, 2,000+ students. The governance toolkit could be framed as educational infrastructure research.

**Key evidence:**
- 11 years of teaching experience across multiple institutions
- The eight-organ system as a model for teaching systems thinking and creative technology
- ORGAN-V public documentation as pedagogical methodology

**Narrative angle:**
"This research investigates how documented governance systems — designed for creative practice — can serve as pedagogical tools for teaching systems thinking, AI literacy, and creative technology. Drawing on 11 years of teaching experience and a five-year creative systems practice, the project develops reusable governance patterns that creative technology educators can adapt."

### Rauschenberg Emergency Grants (Cycle 36) — **MODERATE FIT (6/10)**

**What they fund:** Up to $5,000 emergency grants for artists in digital/electronic arts.

**Why you fit:** Digital/electronic arts practitioner. Emergency need is real.

**Benefits cliff:** SNAP-safe. $5K on $12K base = $17K total, well below all thresholds.

### FCA Emergency Grants — **MODERATE FIT (rolling)**

**What they fund:** $200–$3,000 (average $1,900) for visual/performing artists with a confirmed public presentation of experimental, contemporary work. Monthly review.

**Requirements:** Need to organize a public showing of AI/creative-tech work at a non-commercial venue.

### NYSCA/NYFA Artist Fellowship FY2027 — **FUTURE TARGET**

**What they fund:** $8,000 unrestricted. Expected to open ~May 2026 for FY2027 cycle. Requires fiscal sponsor.

**Action:** Activate Fractured Atlas fiscal sponsorship first (F2 in rolling TODO), then apply when cycle opens.

## LOI Template (Letter of Inquiry)

> **Project Title:** [SPECIFIC OR GENERAL]
>
> **Applicant:** [NAME] — systems artist and builder of the eight-organ creative-institutional system
>
> **Summary:**
> [1-2 sentences describing the specific request]
>
> **Background:**
> Over the past five years, I have developed an eight-organ creative-institutional system that coordinates 97 repositories across theory, generative art, commercial products, governance, public process, community, and marketing. The system includes automated governance (11 GitHub Actions workflows), a machine-readable registry, formal dependency validation, and ~404K+ words of public documentation. All eight organs are currently operational, built through 33 named development sprints using AI tools as compositional instruments.
>
> **What This Grant Would Fund:**
> [Specific deliverables — essays, implementations, community programming, installations]
>
> **Why This Matters:**
> The eight-organ model demonstrates that sustainable creative practice requires institutional infrastructure — not just talent. By treating governance as an artistic medium and documenting the entire system publicly, this work contributes reusable patterns for other creative technologists, small arts organizations, and practitioners operating at the intersection of art and systems design.
>
> **Evidence of Capacity:**
> - 97 repositories across 8 organizations, all operational
> - 82+ CI/CD pipelines, 11 governance workflows, automated monthly audits
> - 41 published essays (~150K words)
> - Flagship projects with >1,000 tests each
> - Complete documentation at portfolio quality (~404K+ words)
> - 33 named development sprints over 5+ years
>
> **Budget:** [AMOUNT]

## Budget Framework (TE-to-Cost Translation)

For grants that require dollar budgets, translate the TE model:

| Activity | TE Budget | Approx. API Cost* | Calendar |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Essay production (5/month) | ~600K TE/month | ~$60/month | Ongoing |
| Implementation sprint (3-5 repos) | ~500K TE | ~$50 | Per quarter |
| Monthly audit + maintenance | ~50K TE/month | ~$5/month | Ongoing |
| Community programming | Manual | ~$0 (time) | Weekly |
| Infrastructure (hosting, domains) | N/A | ~$20/month | Ongoing |

*Based on approximate Claude API pricing at scale. Actual costs vary.

**For grants >$10K:** Include hardware, travel, exhibition costs, community honoraria on top of the infrastructure costs above. The TE model covers content production; the grant covers everything else.

## Key Differentiators for Grant Reviewers

1. **The infrastructure already exists.** You're not proposing to build something — you're showing what you've built and requesting support to sustain and expand it.

2. **Automated governance at solo-practitioner scale.** Monthly audits run automatically. Dependency validation happens on every push. Health checks monitor all 97 repos.

3. **Public documentation as evidence.** Grant reviewers can verify every claim by visiting the public repos. The registry, governance rules, and audit reports are all visible.

4. **Creative-technical integration.** The system is simultaneously infrastructure and artistic output. The governance model IS the artwork.

5. **Sustained practice, not a one-time project.** The eight-organ system has been developing for 5+ years through 33 named sprints. The grant would fund the next phase of an ongoing practice, not a speculative new idea.
