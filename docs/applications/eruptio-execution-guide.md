## 2. DEPLOY life-my--midst--in (X2)

### Steps:
1. Go to https://render.com — sign in with GitHub
2. **New** > **Blueprint** > select `organvm-iii-ergon/life-my--midst--in`
3. Render reads `render.yaml` → provisions `inmidst-web` + `inmidst-api` (both free tier)
4. Click **Apply**

### Environment Variables (on inmidst-api):

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_L6jQf8lbiIVn@ep-dark-cherry-ah3f7vpu-pooler.c-3.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `06478ff96dfbfc3f2ec28be8d0c543ab45c3ce00d54a95cf8b02b9b8ee1ddec5` |
| `PROFILE_KEY_ENC_KEY` | `3ba0e0545c62cd9e9cea1e9d8b1ef26aeaa6f2e3e22376515ac84eda80cedb5e` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |

### Verify:
```
GET <api-url>/health        → {"status":"ok"}
GET <api-url>/ready         → {"status":"ready"}
GET <api-url>/demo/profile  → Full demo profile
```

### After deploy:
- Copy API URL and Web URL
- Copy Deploy Hook URL → add as `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` secret to the repo
- Update `registry-v2.json`: add `"url"`, set `"revenue_status": "beta"`

## 3. GOOGLE CL5 (X1)

**Platform:** creativelab5.com | **No deadline**

### Paste these answers:

**Q1: "What is a 'rule' of creativity you love breaking?"** (138 words)

> "Creativity requires starting from nothing."
>
> The most interesting creative work I've made came from imposing more constraints, not fewer. My eight-organ system enforces a strict no-back-edges rule: theory feeds art, art feeds commerce — never the reverse. That constraint should limit what's possible. Instead, it forces each organ to be genuinely self-sufficient, which produces work that's stranger and more honest than anything I made when everything could depend on everything else.
>
> The governance model — dependency validation, promotion state machines, automated audits — sounds like the opposite of creative freedom. But designing those rules is where the real creative decisions happen. Choosing how work flows between 100 repositories is as much an artistic act as any individual piece the system produces.
>
> I don't break the rule that creativity needs freedom. I break the rule that constraints aren't creative.

**Q2: "What's the best way to gain perspective?"** (156 words)

> Build the system that reveals the system.
>
> For five years I worked across theory, generative art, commercial products, and community projects without seeing how they related. The relationships were there — code reused between projects, ideas flowing from research to art to products — but they were invisible. When I formalized those relationships into the eight-organ model with explicit dependency rules and a machine-readable registry, patterns I'd never noticed became obvious. Theory was feeding art feeding commerce, but only some of the time, and the failures were as revealing as the successes.
>
> Building in public (ORGAN-V) compounds this. Writing ~404K+ words of documentation forced me to articulate decisions I'd made intuitively. The Aetheria post-mortem — honestly documenting a project that traveled the full Theory->Art->Commerce pipeline and partially failed — taught me more about my practice than any success.
>
> The best way to gain perspective: make the invisible structure explicit, then be honest about what you see.

**Q3: "In 1-3 sentences, tell us about the project you are most proud of and why."** (80 words)

> I built an eight-organ system that coordinates 101 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations — governing how theory, generative art, commercial products, and community work flow into each other through automated dependency validation, a promotion state machine, and ~404K+ words of public documentation. I'm most proud of it because it demonstrates that governance and art aren't separate categories: the rules that coordinate the system are as carefully designed as any artwork it produces. It's infrastructure that makes its own logic visible.
