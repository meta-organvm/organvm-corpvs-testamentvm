## Abstract (200 words)

What happens when you treat an AI not as a replacement for a developer, but as an orchestra responding to a conductor? In nine days, I built a 100-repository system spanning 8 organizations — 404,000+ words of documentation, 42 essays, 33 sprints — as a solo operator directing AI generation with human strategic judgment.

This talk introduces the AI-conductor methodology: a structured approach where the human sets direction, defines quality gates, and reviews output, while the AI generates volume at institutional scale. I'll cover the token-based effort model (measuring work in TE, not hours), the quality risks specific to AI-generated content (hallucinated code examples, generic phrasing, incorrect cross-references), and the governance structures that make it work (registries, state machines, dependency graphs).

This is not a talk about prompt engineering. It is a talk about organizational design — how one person can operate a system that would normally require a team, by treating AI as infrastructure rather than intelligence. I'll share the actual decision records, the failures, and the metrics from 33 sprints of sustained operation.

## Outline (30-minute talk)

### 1. The Problem (5 min)
- Solo operators face institutional-scale demands: documentation, governance, distribution
- Traditional approach: "just hire someone" is not always an option
- The gap between what one person can write and what a system needs

### 2. The Model (8 min)
- Human as conductor, AI as orchestra
- The three phases: direct, generate, review
- Token-based effort model (TE budgets instead of hours)
- Live example: generating a 3,000-word README in 15 minutes of human review time

### 3. The Governance Layer (7 min)
- Why volume without governance creates chaos
- Registry-as-JSON: single source of truth for 100 repos
- Unidirectional dependency flow (DAG enforcement)
- Promotion state machine: when work becomes visible

### 4. The Failure Modes (5 min)
- Hallucinated code examples in AI-generated documentation
- Generic phrasing that makes every README sound the same
- Future-dated essays (VERITAS sprint discovery)
- Billing overruns from automated workflows (48,880 minutes)

### 5. The Evidence (5 min)
- 33 sprints completed, 100 repos documented
- 30-day soak test (autonomous operation verification)
- Distribution pipeline: essays auto-deploy to social channels
- What "done" looks like: omega criteria and exit conditions
