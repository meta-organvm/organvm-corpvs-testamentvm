# AI Engineering Role Research

**Researched:** 2026-02-11
**Companies surveyed:** 7 (Anthropic, OpenAI, HuggingFace, Runway, Together AI, Cohere, Mistral)
**Roles assessed:** 35+
**Top recommendations:** 7 roles across 5 companies

## Fit Assessment Criteria

Profile strengths mapped against role requirements:

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Systems architecture | 78 repos, 8 orgs, dependency validation, promotion state machine |
| Agent orchestration | agentic-titan (1,095 tests, 18 phases), multi-agent coordination |
| Production infrastructure | 65 CI/CD pipelines, 5 governance automations, automated health audits |
| Testing rigor | 1,095 tests (agentic-titan) + 1,254 tests (recursive-engine) |
| Documentation at scale | 289K words, every README portfolio-quality |
| Governance-as-safety | Constitutional constraints, no-back-edge rules, transitive depth limits |
| Developer tools | Orchestration tooling, registry design, audit scripts |

**Profile gap:** No explicit ML model training experience (PyTorch/TensorFlow research). Strongest fit is roles emphasizing systems engineering, developer tools, orchestration, and documentation over pure ML research.

## TIER 1 — Apply Immediately (Strongest Fit)

### 1. Anthropic — Forward Deployed Engineer, Custom Agents

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Title** | Forward Deployed Engineer, Custom Agents |
| **Team** | Custom Agents, Applied AI |
| **Location** | San Francisco or New York City (hybrid 25%, travel 25-50%) |
| **Salary** | $280,000–$400,000 |
| **Apply** | https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/5074695008 |
| **Deadline** | Rolling |

**Requirements:** 4+ years technical customer-facing role, production LLM experience (prompt engineering, agent development, evaluation frameworks), Python proficiency, autonomous operation under ambiguity.

**Why this fits:**
- Building MCP servers, sub-agents, and agent skills IS what the eight-organ system does — orchestration artifacts deployed to production
- The "identify and codify repeatable deployment patterns" responsibility maps directly to registry-v2.json and governance-rules.json
- Forward-deployed model values someone who can represent the company at the highest technical level while communicating clearly — 289K words of documentation proves this
- Agent development experience from agentic-titan directly applicable

**Spotlight repos:** agentic-titan, a-i-council--coliseum, organvm-corpvs-testamentvm, narratological-algorithmic-lenses

**Fit score:** 9/10
