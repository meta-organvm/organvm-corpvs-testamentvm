## Professional Writing Credentials

If the form asks for published work, writing credits, or evidence of professional writing practice:

---

MFA in Creative Writing, Florida Atlantic University (2015–2018). Author of 42 published nonfiction essays totaling ~134,000 words, published via ORGAN-V Public Process (https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/) and distributed via RSS, Mastodon, and Discord. Essays cover creative systems design, AI-augmented production methodology, governance as artistic medium, and building-in-public as creative practice. 11 years teaching writing and creative technology at 8+ institutions, including 100+ courses and 2,000+ students. ~404,000 words of published documentation across 97 repositories in the eight-organ creative-institutional system.

## Financial Hardship Statement

**~200 words**

Copy everything between the lines:

---

I am a NYC-based writer and adjunct instructor earning approximately $12,000 per year. I currently receive SNAP benefits and Medicaid. I live as a licensee in a family member's home — no lease, no guaranteed housing stability. I have no savings, no retirement account, and no secondary income source.

I have applied to roughly 3,000 positions over the past several years — approximately 1,000 teaching jobs and 2,000 marketing and UX roles — without securing stable employment. During this period, I have continued writing: 42 published essays, a 404,000-word documentation corpus, and an ongoing nonfiction practice examining creative systems, AI-augmented production, and governance as artistic medium.

The financial hardship is immediate: I cannot afford basic professional expenses — portfolio hosting, equipment maintenance, transportation to professional events, and the application fees that many grants and residencies require. The $3,500 would directly sustain my ability to continue writing and submitting work during a critical period when multiple grant applications and writing opportunities are active.

I am not asking for support to begin a writing career. I am asking for support to sustain one that is already producing work — 42 essays, 134,000 published words, and a five-year creative practice documented transparently.

## Specific Use of Funds (if form asks)

**~100 words**

---

The funds would cover: (1) professional equipment maintenance and replacement — laptop repairs, software licenses essential for writing and publishing ($800); (2) portfolio and web hosting costs for the public-process essay series and portfolio site ($300/year); (3) transportation to professional events, readings, and networking opportunities in NYC ($400); (4) application fees for grants and residencies currently in the pipeline — Creative Capital, Bread Loaf, residencies with SlideRoom fees ($500); (5) basic living expenses during the current period of financial hardship ($1,500). Total: $3,500.

## Writing Sample Information

If the form asks for a writing sample or asks you to describe your published work:

**Primary writing sample:** "The Solo-Auteur Method: AI as Compositional Instrument" (published 2026-02-18, ~5,000 words). A nonfiction essay examining how solo creative practitioners use AI tools the way Brian Wilson used session musicians — as volume-generation instruments directed by human editorial judgment. Available at: https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/

**Alternate writing sample:** "What I've Done Is What I Am" (published 2026-02-17, ~2,800 words). A confessional-to-analytical essay on creative identity, imposter syndrome, and the gap between self-concept and evidence. Available at the same URL.

**Full publication list:** 42 published nonfiction essays across categories: meta-system analysis, case studies, methodology guides, and retrospectives. All publicly accessible at https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **Form asks for PEN membership:** You do NOT need to be a member. If the form implies membership is required, check the eligibility criteria again — the U.S. Writers Aid Initiative explicitly does not require membership.
- **Form asks for a published book:** You do not have a published book. Lead with: "42 published nonfiction essays (~134,000 words) constituting the documentation of a five-year creative practice." The volume and consistency demonstrate professional-level output.
- **Form asks for income documentation:** Be prepared to provide: last tax return showing ~$12K AGI, SNAP benefit letter, or a brief statement of income sources.
- **Word limits tighter than expected:** For the hardship statement, cut the second paragraph (the 3,000 jobs paragraph). The first and third paragraphs carry the essential information: current financial situation + what the funds would do.
- **They ask "why not apply for a regular job?":** Do not answer this question defensively. The 42 essays and 5-year practice IS the answer — this is a professional writing career in progress, not a hobby.
