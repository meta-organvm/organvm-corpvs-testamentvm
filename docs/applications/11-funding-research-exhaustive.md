### Prix Ars Electronica 2026

- **Amount:** EUR 10,000 per category + Golden Nica trophy. Categories include Digital Music & Sound Art, Computer Animation, and new AI-related categories.
- **Deadline:** March 4, 2026. Free to submit.
- **Why it fits:** The 100-repo governance-as-art system is exactly what Ars Electronica celebrates — art that is formally innovative through technology. The organ system as a living creative work built with AI-conductor methodology is a strong Ars Electronica narrative.
- **URL:** https://ars.electronica.art/prix/en/opencall/
- **Benefits cliff:** International prize, lump-sum. SNAP-safe.

### S+T+ARTS Prize 2026

- **Amount:** EUR 20,000 per prize (Grand Prize for Artistic Exploration + Grand Prize for Innovative Collaboration)
- **Deadline:** March 4, 2026.
- **Why it fits:** S+T+ARTS (Science + Technology + ARTS) Prize seeks "projects at the nexus of science, technology, and the arts that have the potential to contribute to economic and social innovation." The organ system IS this — governance infrastructure that enables creative production at scale.
- **URL:** https://starts-prize.aec.at/en/open-call/
- **Benefits cliff:** International prize, lump-sum. SNAP-safe.

### PEN America U.S. Writers Aid Initiative

- **Amount:** Up to $3,500 (rolling)
- **Why it fits:** **HIGHEST-FIT emergency fund.** MFA + 42 published essays = clearly professional writer. Nonfiction explicitly eligible. Housing-precarious situation is exactly what this fund targets. PEN membership NOT required. Max 2 grants lifetime.
- **URL:** https://pen.org/us-writers-aid-initiative/
- **Contact:** writersfund@pen.org
- **Benefits cliff:** SNAP-safe (lump-sum).

### Awesome Foundation NYC Chapter

- **Amount:** $1,000, no strings attached, monthly
- **Why it fits:** Zero restrictions. The 100-repo organ system is exactly the kind of "awesome" project they fund. No reporting requirements.
- **URL:** https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/nyc
- **Benefits cliff:** SNAP-safe.

### Doris Duke Foundation / Mozilla "Artists Make Technology Lab"

- **Amount:** Up to $150,000 per project (up to 20 grants awarded)
- **Deadline:** March 2, 2026 at 12:00 ET (application portal opened February 2)
- **Why it fits:** "Bold ideas in the performing arts that engage digital tools, innovative data practices and emerging production methods." The organ system's AI-conductor methodology IS an emerging production method. Community salons (ORGAN-VI) have performative dimensions. The governance-as-choreography metaphor is genuine — coordinating 100 repos through documented governance rules IS choreography of creative production. **HIGHEST SINGLE AMOUNT IN THE PIPELINE.** Even at 7/10 fit, the expected value justifies the application investment.
- **Performing arts framing challenge:** The primary criteria specify "performing arts" — the organ system is systems art, not performance per se. However, "innovative data practices and emerging production methods" is a strong secondary match. Frame ORGAN-VI community salons as performative, governance as choreography, and the public-process essays as performed documentation.
- **URL:** https://www.dorisduke.org/grants/projects/artists-make-technology-lab
- **Benefits cliff:** $150K → well above all thresholds. Essential Plan bridge. Call NYLAG.

### Watermill Center Summer Program

- **Why it fits:** Interdisciplinary lab on Long Island founded by Robert Wilson. 4 weeks (July 5 - August 2, 2026). "All disciplines including visual arts, new media, performance, interdisciplinary arts, literature." The organ system as creative-technological practice fits the interdisciplinary mandate. Free housing/food eliminates financial barrier.
- **URL:** https://www.watermillcenter.org/summer/
- **Benefits cliff:** Not income (residency support covers program costs).

### ACC CREATORS 2026 Residency (Gwangju, South Korea)

- **Amount:** Project budget KRW 20-30 million (~$15,000-22,000 USD) + individual stipend ~$1,850 + travel + workspace + accommodation
- **Deadline:** **March 1, 2026, 23:59 KST**
- **Why it fits:** 5-month Art & Technology residency. Theme: "Speculative Communities." AI, VR, XR, robotics, IoT explicitly welcome. 8 teams/individuals selected. The organ system's speculative-community-building ethos is a direct match. **Caveat:** 5-month South Korea relocation (June-November 2026).
- **URL:** https://www.acc.go.kr/en/board/board.do?PID=1001&boardID=NOTICE&action=Read&idx=2676
- **Benefits cliff:** International stipend. SNAP treatment unclear — call NYLAG.

### Stimpunks Foundation Creator Grant

- **Amount:** $3,000 (5 grants per year; pipeline reopened January 2026)

- **Why it fits:** **HIGHEST-VALUE NYC-specific opportunity.** Housing-precarious (licensee in parent's home = no lease). Low income qualifies. NYC resident. The catch: must be a "visual artist" in specified media — confirm digital/generative art eligibility with NYFA.
