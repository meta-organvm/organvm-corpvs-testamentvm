## Narrative Description

Working artist with an active, documented creative practice: 100 repositories, 42 published essays, ~410K+ of public documentation — all built over 5+ years of sustained work. MFA Creative Writing (Florida Atlantic University, 2015-2018). 11 years teaching at 8+ institutions.

## Artist Statement (short)

---

I build creative systems — the governance IS the artwork. My eight-organ system coordinates 100 repositories across 8 organizations — spanning theory, generative art, commerce, governance, public process, community, and marketing. 42 published essays document the methodology in real time. Solo production using AI tools as compositional instruments.
