## Quality Assurance Process (AI + Human)

**For each README:**

1. AI generates draft from organ-specific template + repo context
2. AI validation pass: template compliance, link checking, cross-reference verification, word count
3. Human strategic review: accuracy, positioning, portfolio language, repo-specific voice
4. Human revises AI output for project-specific accuracy
5. Final human sign-off
6. Commit to main branch

**Red flags during review:**
- Generic AI phrasing not customized to specific repo
- Hallucinated code examples or cross-references
- Broken links (internal or external)
- Missing cross-references
- Outdated information
- Boilerplate problem statements (not repo-specific)
- Less than minimum word count

**If red flags found:** Send back for revision. Don't commit incomplete work.
