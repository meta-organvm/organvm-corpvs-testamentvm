# PHASE 1: MASTER SUMMARY — Documentation Audit (Sprints 1-2, ~4.4M TE)

> **Note:** Effort estimates in this document use TE (Tokens-Expended) — the native unit for AI-conductor workflows. Legacy hour estimates have been superseded by `roadmap-there-and-back-again.md` (revised Feb 9, 2026). This document is retained for its detailed subtask descriptions, decision matrices, and quality criteria.

**Duration:** 14 days (Feb 10-23, 2026)
**Total Effort:** ~4.4M TE (across 4 parallel generation streams)
**Goal:** All 44 repos + 14 local repos have comprehensive, current READMEs  
**Owner:** You (@4444j99)  
**Status:** Ready to execute

## Strategic Context: Why Phase 1 Is Make-or-Break

### For Parallel Launch

You're launching all 8 organs simultaneously. External evaluators (grants, hiring, residencies) will see your system for the first time on day 1. **Their first impression is READMEs.**

On launch day, someone from Knight Foundation, Anthropic, or Eyebeam will:
1. Click your GitHub org link
2. Scan 3-5 repository READMEs
3. Form judgment: "This looks professional" OR "This looks half-finished"

**Quality of READMEs determines external perception more than code quality.**

### For Portfolio Positioning

Meta-system documentation (registry, governance, essays) is your competitive differentiator. But if individual repo READMEs are vague or outdated, the entire system looks incoherent.

**Strong READMEs convey:**
- Professional maturity (everything is documented + current)
- Systems thinking (clear connections between repos)
- Sustained effort (not a weekend project)
- Respect for users (clear examples + guidance)

## Three Critical Decisions (Make Sprint 1)

### Decision #1: Personal Account Consolidation (Subtask 1.10)

**Current state:** 8 repos in personal account (4444J99), rest in orgs. Decision: keep personal account or migrate everything to orgs?

**Option A: Archive Personal Account (RECOMMENDED)**
- Migrate all working repos to appropriate orgs
- Archive personal account as read-only
- Result: Single source of truth
- Effort: ~88K TE migration + ~50K TE redirect links
- Benefit: Cleaner automation, no dual maintenance

**Option B: Mirror to Orgs**
- Keep personal account live
- Maintain mirrors in org accounts  
- Result: Two sources of truth
- Effort: Ongoing ~150K-225K TE per quarter
- Downside: Confusing, breaks automation assumptions

**Recommendation:** **Option A (Archive).** Single source of truth is architecturally cleaner and necessary for Phase 3 automation. Personal account can be preserved as read-only archive indefinitely.

**Decision deadline:** Thursday, Feb 13 (end of Sprint 1)

### Decision #2: Local Repos Public/Private Classification (Subtask 1.2)

**Current state:** 14 local repos to migrate to GitHub. Per-repo decision: public or private visibility?

**Decision framework:**

| Organ | Visibility | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| ORGAN-I (Theory) | PUBLIC | Portfolio value = high; risk = low |
| ORGAN-II (Art) | PUBLIC | Portfolio value = critical; risk = low |
| ORGAN-III (Commerce) | PRIVATE | Confidential business data; governance needs protection |
| ORGAN-IV (Orchestration) | SEMI-PUBLIC | Registry public, detailed governance rules private |
| ORGAN-V (Public) | PUBLIC | Essays/process documentation must be visible |
| ORGAN-VI (Community) | PRIVATE | Invitation-only participation; archival value only |
| ORGAN-VII (Marketing) | PRIVATE | Internal distribution logistics; no external need |

**Action:** Classify each of 14 local repos, record in registry-v2.json

**Decision deadline:** Friday, Feb 14 (end of Sprint 1)

### Decision #3: Empty/Skeleton Repos (Subtask 1.2)

**Current state:** ORGAN-II has ~8 empty or skeleton repos. Decision: populate or archive?

**Decision matrix per repo:**

| Repo | Status | Decision | Why | Effort |
|------|--------|----------|-----|--------|
| showcase-portfolio | Empty | POPULATE | Critical for visibility | ~110K TE |
| archive-past-works | Empty | POPULATE | Portfolio completeness | ~88K TE |
| case-studies-methodology | Empty | POPULATE | Demonstrates practice | ~135K TE |
| example-generative-music | Skeleton | POPULATE | Flagship example | ~180K TE |
| example-choreographic-interface | Skeleton | EVALUATE | Value if active project | 0-135K TE |
| example-generative-visual | Empty | ARCHIVE | Too generic; low specificity | ~12K TE |
| example-interactive-installation | Empty | ARCHIVE | Placeholder; not real project | ~12K TE |
| example-ai-collaboration | Empty | ARCHIVE | Too vague; confuses focus | ~12K TE |
| learning-resources | Empty | EVALUATE | Value for community? | 0-110K TE |
| docs-core-system | Empty | MERGE | Consolidate into core-engine README | ~12K TE |

**Recommendation:** 
- Populate critical ones (showcase, archive, case-studies, 1-2 flagship examples)
- Archive generic/placeholder repos
- Consolidate misc docs into core READMEs
- Result: 60 public repos, all with clear purpose

**Decision deadline:** Friday, Feb 14 (end of Sprint 1)

## Portfolio Positioning in READMEs

As you write each README, embed strategic language:

### For AI Systems Engineering Roles
- Emphasize architecture thinking (design decisions)
- Show trade-offs explicitly (why this vs. that?)
- Link to ORGAN-IV orchestration (proof of systems thinking)
- Include governance/SLA language (production maturity)

### For Creative Grants (Knight, Mellon, NSF)
- Emphasize capacity + sustainability
- Link to ORGAN-V essays (building in public)
- Show metrics from ORGAN-III (proof of impact)
- Include organizational structure notes

### For Residencies (Eyebeam, Somerset House, Processing)
- Emphasize community + collaboration
- Link to ORGAN-VI infrastructure
- Show replicability (others can learn)
- Include accessibility/equity language

**Each README is a mini-portfolio piece, not just documentation.**

## Critical Success Factors

**Factor 1: Don't Skip Sprint 1 Planning**
- Tempting to start generating immediately
- Reality: planning up front prevents costly rework downstream
- Complete all 5 documents before generating a single README

**Factor 2: Use Templates Religiously**
- All 7 organ templates provided (Document 03)
- Use verbatim for first draft, customize after
- Saves ~30% of generation TE across 44 repos

**Factor 3: Complete Before Moving Forward**
- Don't start Phase 2 with partial documentation
- All 44 repos need comprehensive README
- One incomplete repo breaks validation chain

**Factor 4: AI Validation + Human Review for Every README**
- AI performs first-pass validation (template compliance, link checking, cross-references)
- Human does strategic review (positioning, tone, portfolio language)
- Consistency across 59 repos maintained by AI checklist automation

**Factor 5: Make Documentation Portfolio-Ready**
- Every README is external-facing
- Write for grant reviewers + hiring managers, not just developers
- Include why-this-exists + how-it-connects language

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Accepting AI-generated drafts without customization**
- Temptation: Approve generic AI output that hits word count but lacks project specifics
- Reality: AI generates fluent prose but may miss project-specific context, nuances, and voice
- Fix: Every README must be reviewed for repo-specific accuracy — examples, architecture decisions, and portfolio language must reflect actual project state

**Pitfall 2: Hallucinated examples or references**
- Temptation: Trust AI-generated code examples and cross-references without verification
- Reality: AI may fabricate plausible-sounding code snippets, API calls, or repo links that don't exist
- Fix: Test every code example. Verify every cross-reference link. Validate every claim against actual repo content

**Pitfall 3: Ignore broken links**
- Temptation: Push documentation without testing links
- Reality: Broken links destroy credibility
- Fix: Validate all links (internal + external) before commit — automated link checking is part of AI validation pass

**Pitfall 4: Generic phrasing across repos**
- Temptation: Let AI use the same "this project provides a framework for..." boilerplate across 44 repos
- Reality: Each repo has unique purpose + context; identical phrasing signals template laziness
- Fix: Review each README for distinctive voice — problem statements, examples, and portfolio language must be repo-specific

**Pitfall 5: Missing cross-references**
- Temptation: Each repo documented in isolation
- Reality: System is only coherent if connections visible
- Fix: Every README links upstream (dependencies) + downstream (users) — AI can generate these but human must verify accuracy
