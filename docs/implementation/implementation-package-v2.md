# IMPLEMENTATION PACKAGE: Eight-Organ Parallel Launch (v2.0)

> **Note:** Effort estimates in this document use TE (tokens-expended) as the unit of work, reflecting the AI-conductor workflow model. Timeline references use sprints (not weeks). The canonical execution plan is `roadmap-there-and-back-again.md` (revised Feb 9, 2026). This document is retained for its detailed strategic framing, subtask descriptions, and portfolio positioning guidance.

> **Post-Cross-Validation (2026-02-09):** Phase 1 scope is now Bronze (see `08-canonical-action-plan.md` §3), not all 44 repos. NSF Convergence Accelerator deprioritized (§6). Repo counts corrected. Per-task TE estimates remain valid as reference points but are now expressed as scenario bands (D-01).

**Package Version:** 2.0 (Parallel All-Organs Deployment)
**Created:** 2026-02-03  
**Launch:** Criteria-driven (per D-08 in `08-canonical-action-plan.md`)
**Total Budget:** ~6.5M TE (tokens-expended) across 4 sprints
**Deployment Model:** All 8 organs operational simultaneously  
**Portfolio Strategy:** Meta-system documentation as primary asset for grants, hiring, residencies  

---

## Strategic Context: Why Now? Why All at Once?

### The 2026 Funding Landscape Shift

Research shows **meta-system documentation is increasingly valued by:**

1. **AI Systems Engineering Roles** (Anthropic, OpenAI, Runway, etc.)
   - Hiring managers explicitly value "production-ready thinking" over credentials
   - Portfolio differentiator: architectural reasoning, trade-off analysis, systems documentation
   - Your advantage: 8-organ registry + governance rules = evidence of handling complexity

2. **Creative/Technical Grants** (Knight Foundation, Mellon, NEA)
   - Knight Foundation "Art + Tech Expansion Fund" explicitly funds infrastructure, not just projects
   - Mellon seeks "organizational models reflecting holistic approach to social change"
   - Your advantage: All 8 organs + orchestration layer = sustained capacity

3. **Technology Residencies & Fellowships** (Eyebeam, Somerset House, Processing, Google Creative)
   - Explicitly evaluate "community contribution" and "reusable infrastructure"
   - Value "artist-engineer" hybrid profile with systemic thinking
   - Your advantage: Full ecosystem visible (all 8 organs + governance) = systemic artist

### Why Parallel Launch?

**Simultaneous launch makes meta-system visible immediately.**

- Sequential launch (ORGAN-I Sprint 1, ORGAN-III Sprint 2, etc.) delays system visibility until Sprint 4
- External evaluators see incomplete system for 3+ sprints
- Parallel launch = full system visible day 1 = ready for applications

---

## What You Have: Five Complete Design Documents

### 1. **registry-v2.json** (Central Registry)
- All 44 repos mapped to 8 organs
- 14 local repos integrated
- Portfolio relevance scoring (for external visibility)
- Documentation status per repo (README? Case study? Governance docs?)
- Cross-organ relationships fully specified

**For applications:** Proof of systems thinking and architectural capacity

### 2. **orchestration-system-v2.md** (Governance)
- Promotion criteria (Theory→Art, Art→Commerce, etc.)
- Dependency rules (no cycles, upward flow only)
- Health checks (monthly system validation)
- How documentation becomes portfolio asset
- Parallel launch coordination

**For applications:** Evidence of governance-first design and transparency

### 3. **github-actions-spec.md** (Automation Stack - unchanged from v1)

- All workflows active from day 1 (parallel model)
- Reusable actions for cross-repo automation
- Python helper scripts included

**For applications:** Production-ready infrastructure automation

### 4. **public-process-map-v2.md** (ORGAN-V - Documentation Layer)

## Three Application Strategies

### Strategy 1: AI Systems Engineering Roles

**Target orgs:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Runway, Together AI, Hugging Face, Perplexity, Mistral  
**Positioning:** Lead with ORGAN-IV (orchestration) documentation

```
Cover letter: "I've built an 8-organ creative infrastructure coordinating ~44 repos
across theory, art, and commerce. The orchestration layer demonstrates architectural 
reasoning, trade-off analysis, and production-ready thinking."

Portfolio: Link to:
  - registry.json (shows systems thinking)
  - orchestration-system-v2.md (shows governance/trade-offs)
  - github-actions-spec.md (shows automation design)
  - Live working system on GitHub

Interview discussion:
  - Walk through registry schema choices (why JSON? Why this structure?)
  - Explain dependency validation approach (why these rules prevent failures?)
  - Discuss promotion criteria (what happens when systems move between organs?)
  - Show trade-offs made (automation vs. manual review, centralized vs. distributed)
```

**Why effective:** Demonstrates systems thinking at scale. Shows you've thought deeply about complexity, failure modes, and sustainability.

### Strategy 2: Grant Funding (Knight, Mellon, NSF, NEA)

**Target programs:** 
- Knight Foundation "Art + Tech Expansion Fund" ($$$$ for capacity, not projects)
- Mellon Foundation "Arts & Culture" (organizational innovation)
- ~~NSF "Convergence Accelerator"~~ — deprioritized per `08-canonical-action-plan.md` §6 (requires team-led consortium; poor fit for solo operator)
- NEA "Grants for Arts Projects" (project + capacity component)

**Positioning:** Lead with ORGAN-V (Public Process) + Show registry as evidence

```
Grant proposal opening: "This project demonstrates long-term digital capacity through 
a systems-based approach to creative work. The eight-organ model coordinates theory, 
art, commerce, and community—all documented publicly for transparency and reproducibility."

Evidence sections:
  - ORGAN-V essays (show "building in public")
  - registry.json + governance docs (show organizational thinking)
  - Revenue metrics from ORGAN-III (show sustainability)
  - Community participation from ORGAN-VI (show ecosystem contribution)

Sustainability section:
  - "The orchestration layer enables ongoing work beyond this grant period"
  - "All systems documented for knowledge transfer"
  - "Cross-organ workflows reduce dependency on any single project"
```

**Why effective for Knight Foundation specifically:** "The Fund is not project-based... Grants designed to support long-term digital capacity." Your 8-organ model IS long-term capacity infrastructure.

**Why effective for Mellon:** "Interest in new organizational structures reflecting artists' holistic approach." Eight organs = holistic structure documented.

### Strategy 3: Residencies & Fellowships

**Target programs:**
- Eyebeam "Democracy Machine Fellowship" (equitable systems, artist-led)
- Somerset House "Creative Technologies Fellowship" (practice-led research)
- Processing Foundation Fellowship (documentation + reusable infrastructure)
- Google Creative Fellowship (artist-engineer hybrid)
- Microsoft AI Residency (AI + artistic practice)

**Positioning:** Lead with ALL 8 ORGANS as unified ecosystem

```
Application opening: "As an artist-engineer building autonomous creative systems, 
I've developed an eight-organ infrastructure for coordinating theory, art, and 
commerce work. All systems are publicly documented to enable collaboration and 
community contribution."

Distinctive elements:
  - ORGAN-IV: Governance model others can learn from
  - ORGAN-V: Transparent documentation of process
  - ORGAN-VI: Community participation infrastructure
  - All organs: Evidence of systemic artistic practice

What you'd contribute to their community:
  - Documentation-first approach to systems building
  - Governance protocols for multi-system coordination
  - Model of "building in public" with infrastructure transparency
  - Cross-disciplinary (theory+art+tech+commerce) perspective
```

**Why effective for Processing Foundation:** They explicitly want "infrastructure that enables others to carry on." Your documented systems + ORGAN-V essays = exactly this.

**Why effective for Eyebeam:** They seek "equitable systems in support of creativity." ORGAN-VI community infrastructure + transparent governance = systemic equity.

- Mitigation: Use templates, leverage existing repo content

**Risk 2: Dependencies initially broken**
- Mitigation: Phase 2 validation catches these before public launch

**Risk 3: Simultaneous multi-organ testing complexity**
- Mitigation: Validate each organ independently (Phase 2), then integrate (Phase 3)

**Risk 4: Personal account consolidation unclear**
- Mitigation: Make explicit decision by end of Sprint 1

**Risk 5: Local repos integration challenging**
- Mitigation: Migrate incrementally, test thoroughly before public

---
