# ORGANVM — System Overview

## What It Is

ORGANVM is an eight-organ creative-institutional system coordinating 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations. Each organ governs a domain — from epistemological theory (ORGAN-I) through generative art (ORGAN-II), commercial products (ORGAN-III), orchestration governance (ORGAN-IV), public documentation (ORGAN-V), community infrastructure (ORGAN-VI), marketing distribution (ORGAN-VII), to meta-system governance (META).

## Key Metrics

- **97 repositories** across 8 organizations
- **93 ACTIVE repos** (100% of non-archived)
- **36 published essays** (~132,000 words) documenting the build process
- **43 registry dependency edges** with zero back-edge violations
- **94+ CI/CD workflows** with automated validation
- **33 sprints completed** from initial architecture to operational readiness

## Methodology

The system operates on an **AI-conductor model**: AI generates volume, human directs architecture and reviews output. This methodology enabled a single operator to build, document, and validate 103 repositories in under a week — demonstrating production-grade systems thinking at scale.

## Strategic Context

Meta-system documentation (governance, orchestration, infrastructure) strengthens applications across: (1) AI systems engineering roles at research labs, (2) Creative/technical grants (NSF, NEA, Mellon, Knight Foundation), (3) Technology residencies and fellowships. This registry demonstrates orchestration capacity, architectural reasoning, and systemic sustainability—competitive differentiators in 2026 funding landscape.

## Evidence

Artists like Julian Oliver, Nicky Case, and Hundred Rabbits (Devine Lu Linvega & Rekka Bellum) treat protocols and governance structures as primary artistic output, demonstrating that small-scale sustainable creative infrastructure with extensive documentation receives institutional recognition (updated per 08-CANONICAL-ACTION-PLAN.md §7). Programs like Knight Foundation Art+Tech Expansion Fund, Processing Foundation Fellowship, Google Creative Fellowship explicitly evaluate infrastructure contribution and organizational capacity.

## Opportunity

Position the eight-organ system as evidence of: (a) production-ready thinking (hiring), (b) long-term digital capacity and sustainability (grants), (c) community contribution and reusable infrastructure (residencies). All organs launch simultaneously to demonstrate integrated systems thinking.
