# Application: Knight Foundation Art+Tech

**Category**: Grant
**Framing**: Infrastructure as creative practice
**Lead Organs**: ORGAN-V, ORGAN-IV, META
**Lead Material**: ORGAN-V essays + registry + governance model

## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology, the system coordinates 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 43 registry dependency edges, 115 seed.yaml contract edges, and zero back-edge violations.

This application highlights the system's relevance to Knight Foundation Art+Tech through:

- Systemic creative infrastructure
- Documentation as artistic output
- Multi-organ coordination as institutional design

## Why Knight Foundation Art+Tech

Infrastructure as creative practice. The eight-organ architecture demonstrates that creative infrastructure — the protocols, governance structures, and coordination systems underlying artistic production — is itself a form of creative practice. Artists like Julian Oliver, Nicky Case, and Hundred Rabbits treat protocols and governance as primary artistic output. ORGANVM extends this tradition to institutional scale.
