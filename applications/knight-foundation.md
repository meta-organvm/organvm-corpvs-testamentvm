**Category**: Grant
**Framing**: Infrastructure as creative practice
**Lead Organs**: ORGAN-V, ORGAN-IV, META
**Lead Material**: ORGAN-V essays + registry + governance model

## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology (human directs architecture and decisions; AI generates documentation, CI pipelines, and boilerplate at volume; human reviews and refines), the system coordinates 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 31 tracked dependency relationships, 115 inter-repository contracts defining data flow, and zero circular dependencies.

This application highlights the system's relevance to Knight Foundation Art+Tech through:

- Systemic creative infrastructure as artistic practice
- 28+ published essays documenting the build process in real time
- Multi-organ coordination as a model for sustainable institutional design

## Why Knight Foundation Art+Tech

The Knight Foundation champions projects where technology enables civic and cultural infrastructure. ORGANVM treats the infrastructure itself — the registries, governance protocols, dependency graphs, and coordination systems — as primary creative output. This follows the tradition of artists like Julian Oliver (critical engineering), Nicky Case (explorable explanations), and Hundred Rabbits (off-grid creative tools) who treat protocols and systems as artistic material. What distinguishes ORGANVM is scale: eight interconnected organs with automated orchestration, a public essay corpus documenting every decision, and a governance model designed for long-term sustainability — exactly the kind of infrastructure thinking the Art+Tech program supports.
