**Category**: Fellowship
**Framing**: Artist-engineer hybrid + ORGAN-II/III bridge
**Lead Organs**: ORGAN-II, ORGAN-III
**Lead Material**: Art-commerce bridge + generative systems

## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology, the system coordinates 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 31 registry dependency edges, 115 seed.yaml contract edges, and zero back-edge violations.

This application highlights the system's relevance to Google Creative Fellowship through:

- Artist-engineer hybrid practice
- Generative systems with commercial viability
- AI-augmented creative workflow

## Why Google Creative Fellowship

Artist-engineer hybrid + ORGAN-II/III bridge. The eight-organ architecture demonstrates that creative infrastructure — the protocols, governance structures, and coordination systems underlying artistic production — is itself a form of creative practice. Artists like Julian Oliver, Nicky Case, and Hundred Rabbits treat protocols and governance as primary artistic output. ORGANVM extends this tradition to institutional scale.
