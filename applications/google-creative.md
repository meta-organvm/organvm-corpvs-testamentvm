## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology (human directs architecture and decisions; AI generates documentation, CI pipelines, and boilerplate at volume; human reviews and refines), the system coordinates 91 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 31 tracked dependency relationships, 115 inter-repository contracts defining data flow, and zero circular dependencies.

This application highlights the system's relevance to Google Creative Fellowship through:

- Artist-engineer hybrid practice spanning generative art, real-time performance, and educational games
- Bridging creative systems (ORGAN-II) with commercial products (ORGAN-III) through shared infrastructure
- AI-augmented creative workflow with documented methodology

## Why Google Creative Fellowship

Google Creative Lab values practitioners who work fluidly between art and engineering. ORGANVM embodies this hybrid practice: ORGAN-II houses a real-time performance engine (Omni-Dromenon) with audio synthesis, generative music, and choreographic notation systems, while ORGAN-III builds commercial products (educational RPG, coaching platform, real estate tools) on the same infrastructure. The bridge between these organs — where generative art techniques become product features and commercial constraints sharpen artistic tools — is the core creative thesis. The AI-conductor methodology itself is a contribution to creative technology practice, demonstrating how a single operator can build and coordinate systems at institutional scale.
