## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology, the system coordinates 103 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 43 registry dependency edges, 115 seed.yaml contract edges, and zero back-edge violations.

This application highlights the system's relevance to Eyebeam Residency through:

- Equitable creative infrastructure
- Community governance model
- Technology as institutional practice

## Why Eyebeam Residency

Equitable systems + community infrastructure. The eight-organ architecture demonstrates that creative infrastructure — the protocols, governance structures, and coordination systems underlying artistic production — is itself a form of creative practice. Artists like Julian Oliver, Nicky Case, and Hundred Rabbits treat protocols and governance as primary artistic output. ORGANVM extends this tradition to institutional scale.
