## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology (human directs architecture and decisions; AI generates documentation, CI pipelines, and boilerplate at volume; human reviews and refines), the system coordinates 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 33 tracked dependency relationships, 115 inter-repository contracts defining data flow, and zero circular dependencies.

This application highlights the system's relevance to Eyebeam Residency through:

- Equitable creative infrastructure designed for community participation
- Governance model with transparent promotion criteria and public decision records
- Technology as institutional practice — the system is both the artwork and the institution

## Why Eyebeam Residency

Eyebeam's mission centers on artists who use technology to challenge power structures and create equitable systems. ORGANVM is an experiment in building creative infrastructure that is transparent by default — every governance decision is documented, every promotion criterion is public, and the entire build process is narrated through 28+ essays. The community organ (ORGAN-VI) provides salon infrastructure and reading group coordination, while the public process organ (ORGAN-V) ensures that the system's evolution is legible to outsiders. A residency at Eyebeam would focus on opening this infrastructure to external participants — testing whether a system designed by one operator can become genuinely communal.
