# Application: AI Systems Engineering Role

**Category**: Job
**Framing**: Production-grade multi-agent orchestration
**Lead Organs**: ORGAN-IV, ORGAN-I, META
**Lead Material**: Orchestration design + registry walkthrough

## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology, the system coordinates 89 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 33 registry dependency edges, 115 seed.yaml contract edges, and zero back-edge violations.

This application highlights the system's relevance to AI Systems Engineering Role through:

- Multi-agent system architecture
- Production orchestration at scale (82 repos, 33 registry dependencies)
- AI-conductor workflow methodology
- Dependency graph management and validation

## Why AI Systems Engineering Role

Production-grade multi-agent orchestration. The eight-organ architecture demonstrates that creative infrastructure — the protocols, governance structures, and coordination systems underlying artistic production — is itself a form of creative practice. Artists like Julian Oliver, Nicky Case, and Hundred Rabbits treat protocols and governance as primary artistic output. ORGANVM extends this tradition to institutional scale.
