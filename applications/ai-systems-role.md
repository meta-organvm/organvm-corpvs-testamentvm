## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology (human directs architecture and decisions; AI generates documentation, CI pipelines, and boilerplate at volume; human reviews and refines), the system coordinates 89 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 33 tracked dependency relationships, 115 inter-repository contracts defining data flow, and zero circular dependencies.

This application highlights the system's relevance to AI Systems Engineering Role through:

- Multi-agent system architecture with typed message-passing and workflow orchestration
- Automated orchestration at scale (82 active repos, 33 dependency relationships, 11 GitHub Actions workflows)
- AI-conductor workflow methodology — a replicable framework for human-AI collaborative system building
- Dependency graph management with automated cycle detection and validation

## Why AI Systems Engineering Role

ORGANVM demonstrates the engineering challenges of coordinating autonomous subsystems — the same problems that arise in multi-agent AI deployments, distributed systems, and ML infrastructure. The orchestration layer (ORGAN-IV) manages cross-repository dispatch events, automated promotion pipelines, and dependency validation — practical experience with the coordination primitives that production AI systems require. The recursive engine (ORGAN-I) implements typed symbolic processing with 1,254 tests and 85% coverage, demonstrating the testing rigor expected in production AI systems.
