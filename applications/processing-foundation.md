## Project Statement

ORGANVM is a living creative-institutional system — eight interconnected organs governing theory, art, commerce, orchestration, public process, community, marketing, and meta-governance. Built by a single operator using an AI-conductor methodology (human directs architecture and decisions; AI generates documentation, CI pipelines, and boilerplate at volume; human reviews and refines), the system coordinates 97 repositories across 8 GitHub organizations with 33 tracked dependency relationships, 115 inter-repository contracts defining data flow, and zero circular dependencies.

This application highlights the system's relevance to Processing Foundation Fellowship through:

- Generative art and music systems built on recursive symbolic engines
- Open-source creative tools with documented architecture and test coverage
- A replicable methodology for solo artists building systems at institutional scale

## Why Processing Foundation Fellowship

The Processing Foundation supports projects that expand access to creative coding and contribute reusable infrastructure to the community. ORGANVM's generative systems — a real-time performance engine with audio synthesis bridges, a generative music framework, and a recursive symbolic operating system with 1,254 tests — are built to be legible and extensible. The public essay corpus (28+ essays) documents not just what was built but how and why, making the methodology itself a teaching resource. A fellowship would focus on extracting the most reusable components (the generative music framework, the recursive engine's symbolic DSL) into standalone Processing-compatible libraries with tutorials.
