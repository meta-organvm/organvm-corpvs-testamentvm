# INST — Index Rerum Faciendarum

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2026-03-20
**Authority:** META — System-wide governance instrument
**Purpose:** Universal hanging index of things to be done — the canonical gap between what the system IS and what it NEEDS TO BE.

> *Index Rerum Faciendarum* — after the classical scholarly apparatus: *Index Locorum* (places), *Index Nominum* (names), *Index Rerum* (things). The gerundive *faciendarum* transforms reference into obligation: not things that exist, but things that must be made to exist.

### The Four Indices

This document is the first of a four-part classical index apparatus for ORGANVM:

| Index | Latin | Purpose | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Index Rerum Faciendarum** | *Things to be done* | Universal work registry — the gap between IS and NEEDS TO BE | **THIS DOCUMENT** |
| **Index Locorum** | *Index of places* | Canonical map of where everything lives — repos, directories, files, URLs, infrastructure endpoints, deployment targets | IRF-IDX-001 |
| **Index Nominum** | *Index of names* | Registry of all named entities — organs, repos, tools, agents, personas, regimes, orders, specifications, dissertations, people | IRF-IDX-002 |
| **Index Rerum** | *Index of things* | Ontological inventory of what exists — every artifact, its type, its state, its relationships, its provenance | IRF-IDX-003 |

Together, the four indices constitute a complete scholarly apparatus for the system: where things are (Locorum), what they're called (Nominum), what they are (Rerum), and what remains to be done (Rerum Faciendarum). The first three are reference instruments; this one is a governance instrument.

## How to Use This Document

This is a **living governance instrument**, not a snapshot. Every session that produces or discovers work items should update this index. The auditor (`vigiles_engine/auditor.py`) and the omega scorecard (`organvm omega status`) are the primary automated consumers.

**Update protocol:**
1. When a session closes, add completed items to `## Completed` with session ID and date.
2. When new work is discovered, add to the appropriate organ section with priority and source.
3. When work is blocked, move to `| DONE-247 | Cronus Metabolus Core Metabolism Loop (Ingestion, Extraction, Generation, Scoring). | S39 | 2026-03-26 |

## Blocked` with blocking reason.
4. When work becomes irrelevant, move to `## Archived` with reason.

### Completion Logging — External Index Propagation

**REQUIRED:** When work is completed, it MUST be logged not only here but across ALL external indices with an interest. Every completion triggers this checklist:

| # | External Index | When to update | How |
|---|---------------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | **This document** (IRF) | Always | Move item to `## Completed` with session + date |
| 2 | **GitHub Issues** | If a GitHub issue exists for this work | Close the issue with comment referencing commit SHA + IRF ID |
| 3 | **Omega Scorecard** | If the work advances an omega criterion (#1-#19) | Run `organvm omega status` to verify; note criterion state change |
| 4 | **Inquiry Log** | If the work completes/advances an SGO research commission | Update `praxis-perpetua/commissions/inquiry-log.yaml` |
| 5 | **Testament Chain** | If the work is a significant system event (new module, repo, governance change, deployment) | Verify with `organvm testament status` |
| 6 | **Concordance** | If the work introduces or retires governance IDs | Update `docs/operations/concordance.md` |
| 7 | **Registry** | If the work changes repo state (new repo, status/tier change, new edges) | `organvm registry update` |
| 8 | **Seed contracts** | If the work changes repo capabilities, dependencies, or event subscriptions | Update the repo's `seed.yaml` |
| 9 | **CLAUDE.md** | If the work adds/changes modules, routes, tools, commands, or architecture | Update the repo's CLAUDE.md hand-written sections |
| 10 | **Companion indices** | If the work creates new locations (Locorum), names (Nominum), or artifacts (Rerum) | Update the relevant companion index when built |

Not every completion triggers every index. A P2 doc fix may only need #1 and #9. A new engine module needs #1, #2, #5, #7, #8, #9. Use judgment — but the DEFAULT is to check all 10 and consciously skip inapplicable ones, rather than unconsciously miss applicable ones.

**Priority tiers:**
- **P0 — NOW**: Human-gated or zero-cost unblocking actions. Do today.
- **P1 — SOON**: Next-session work. Clear path, no blockers.
- **P2 — GROWTH**: Extends existing capability. No deadline pressure.
- **P3 — HORIZON**: Future work. Requires design or prerequisites.

|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-SYS-024 | P1 | **Create IRF GitHub labels** — `irf`, `slip`, `P0-NOW`, `P1-SOON`, `P2-GROWTH`, `P3-HORIZON`, `organ-I` through `organ-META`, `system`. 14 labels total. Bash creation was rejected in S41 — needs retry. | Agent | S41 IRF reform | None |
| IRF-SYS-025 | P1 | **Build `validate_signal_closure` engine validator** — read entailment_flows from governance-rules.json, check seed.yaml produces edges against required targets, emit violations. Wire into `organvm governance audit --signal-closure`. Tests in `test_governance_signal_closure.py`. | Agent | S41 AX-6 | None |
| IRF-SYS-026 | P1 | **Build `validate_tetradic_self_knowledge` engine validator** — check seed.yaml for telos/pragma/praxis/receptio fields. Wire into `organvm governance audit --self-knowledge`. | Agent | S41 AX-7 | None |
| IRF-SYS-027 | P2 | **Build `organvm chemistry` module** — 5 phases: atomic properties → periodic table → reaction prediction → bottleneck analysis → dashboard. Plan: `.claude/plans/2026-03-30-formation-chemistry.md`. | Agent | S41 formation chemistry spec | None |
| IRF-SYS-028 | P2 | **Build allocative institution** — the economics of the organism. Resource allocation, token economy, attention budget, carrying capacity. Only 1 of 10 institutional classes with no ORGANVM expression. Identified via Three Pillars of Existence analysis. | Agent | S41 three pillars | Design needed |
| IRF-SYS-029 | P1 | **Merge essay-pipeline PR #8** — AX-6 signal closure edges. Branch `feat/ax6-signal-closure-edges` is mergeable but blocked by `test` CI check. Need to ensure CI passes. | Agent | S41 | CI check |
| IRF-SYS-030 | P1 | **Propagate AX-7 telos/pragma/praxis/receptio to seed.yaml schema** — update schema-definitions with v1.2 schema including the 4 tetradic fields + polis. Currently exemplar-only (sovereign-systems). Needs to be in the formal schema. | Agent | S41 AX-7/RR-6 | None |
| IRF-SYS-031 | ~~P0~~ | ~~**Create `~/Workspace/a-organvm/` instance**~~ **DONE S43** — a-organvm/a-organvm created (public), SEED.md (1,208 lines), 36 gate contracts, 73 issues. Design evolved: gate contracts replace lifecycle--preserve/transform containers. | Human+Agent | S42→S43 | None |
| IRF-SYS-032 | P1 | **Build distillatio module** in organvm-engine — `cribrum.py`, `resolutio.py`, `distillatio.py`, `probatio.py`. The river made code. Spec: palingenesis.md v3. | Agent | S42 | IRF-SYS-031 |
| IRF-SYS-033 | ~~P1~~ | ~~**Run cribrum --dry-run**~~ **DONE S43 (method changed)** — stranger agents scanned 250K lines across 20 repos, found 151 modules, 20 isotope clusters. 30 isotopes dissolved in parallel by 3 dissolution agents. Stranger reports at a-organvm/stranger-report-meta.md. | Agent | S42→S43 | None |
| IRF-SYS-034 | ~~P1~~ | ~~**Decompose organvm-engine modules**~~ **DONE S43** — cocoon-map.yaml classifies all 37+ engine modules by mechanism. 36 gate contracts assign each module to a cocoon. 17 cocoons from S43 core session + 19 from Gemini expansion = 36 total cocoons. | Agent | S42→S43 | None |
| IRF-SYS-035 | P1 | **Design Python packaging for {system}--{function} flat namespace** — how do .py function files import each other? Single package? Namespace package? Monorepo pyproject.toml? Must resolve before distillation. | Agent | S42 open question | None |
| IRF-SYS-036 | ~~P1~~ | ~~**Design git architecture for a-organvm/**~~ **DONE S43** — decided: single git repo (a-organvm/a-organvm, public). Gate contracts CALL existing code; code stays in source repos until all gates pass, then emerges. No submodules. The instance IS the gravitational attractor. | Agent | S42→S43 | None |
| IRF-SYS-037 | P2 | **SOP filtration** — apply cribrum heuristics (cosine similarity, liveness, V1-era detection) to 84 governance docs (67 SOPs + 17 ops docs). Produce merge/fuse/archive report. Human review gate. | Agent | S42 | IRF-SYS-032 |
| IRF-SYS-038 | P1 | **Scaffold canonical `src/organvm_engine/` package spine in `a-organvm/`** — once IRF-SYS-035 is ratified, create the minimal package root, cocoon subpackages, import smoke tests, and `pyproject.toml`/test wiring needed so `skeletal--define` can prove itself against a real import surface rather than a hypothetical one. | Agent | S43 relay clarification | IRF-SYS-035 |
| IRF-SYS-039 | P1 | **Build proposal-order inbox for governance change** — accept rules, laws, and new suggestions together with their full originating context; derive impact dispositions, reusable shards that may apply elsewhere, and explicit post-derivation context deficits when more thought is required. Route outputs to the IRF, inquiry log, and affected cocoon contracts rather than leaving them trapped in chat. | Agent | S43 proposal-order request | None |
| IRF-SKL-001 | P2 | Map 142 skills to design-process phases for auto-triggering | Agent | Wants list | Needs phase taxonomy designed |
| IRF-SKL-002 | P2 | Implement hook-based triggering for "universal standards" tier skills | Agent | Wants list | Depends on IRF-SKL-001 |

### The Index Apparatus

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-IDX-001 | P1 | Build INST-INDEX-LOCORUM.md — canonical map of where everything lives: repos (117), directories, key files, URLs, infrastructure endpoints (Cloudflare, GitHub orgs, D1 databases), deployment targets, MCP servers | Agent | This session | Pattern: INST-INDEX-RERUM-FACIENDARUM.md |
| IRF-IDX-002 | P1 | Build INST-INDEX-NOMINUM.md — registry of all named entities: 8 organs, 117 repos, CLI tools (organvm, alchemia, ontologia), agent personas (Architect/QA Lead/Operator/Auditor), 22 regimes, 8 Watcher Orders, 18 SPECs, 64+ SOPs, 3 dissertations (D-001/D-002/D-003), 8 faculties, named protocols (Testament, Descent, Membrane, Styx), people (Chris, the Provost) | Agent | This session | Data exists across registry-v2.json, seed.yaml files, governance docs |
| IRF-IDX-003 | P1 | Build INST-INDEX-RERUM.md — ontological inventory of what exists: every artifact type (YAML spec, Python module, Markdown research, SVG visual, YAML regime, test file, dissertation chapter), its state (implemented/specified/planned), relationships (produces/consumes, depends-on, references), provenance (which session, which commit) | Agent | This session | Ontologia UID system exists for entity identity |
| IRF-IDX-004 | P2 | Create `organvm index generate` CLI command group with subcommands `locorum`, `nominum`, `rerum` that read from registry, seeds, AST, and ontologia to produce the three companion indices as markdown. The existing indexer/ module indexes code structure, not system knowledge — this is a different pipeline | Agent | S28 gap audit | IRF-IDX-001/002/003 define content; this defines tooling |

### Monitoring & Auditing

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-MON-001 | P2 | Deploy vigiles-aeternae watcher orders as scheduled monitoring agents (cron/Actions) | Agent | Wants list, S12 | Code exists, deployment config needed |
| IRF-MON-002 | P2 | Connect auditor findings to omega scorecard — watchers report on criteria health | Agent | Wants list | None |
| IRF-MON-003 | P3 | Continuous auditor mode — IRA running on schedule, not just on-demand | Agent | Wants list | Needs deployment infrastructure |
| ~~IRF-MON-004~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Density delta rendering bug~~ — **DONE-215**: Fixed Python truthiness bug at `contextmd/generator.py:656-657` and semantic ambiguity in `pulse/ammoi.py:_compute_temporal_deltas()`. Changed `float` → `float | None` for delta fields (None = no data, 0.0 = stable). 306 tests pass. Commit `0bf077d` on organvm-engine. | Agent | S35 | Completed 2026-03-25 |
| IRF-MON-005 | P2 | **Pipeline audit trail** — `Last pipeline: unknown` in CLAUDE.md task queue section. The atoms pipeline runs 7 stages, prints a manifest, but never persists execution metadata. Need: persist `pipeline-manifest.json` with `last_run_at`, `duration_seconds`, `stages_completed`, `total_atoms`, `status`. Context generator reads timestamp for "Last pipeline" field. Plan: §V3 | Agent | S35 N/A vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-MON-006 | P1 | **Inter-organ edges placeholder** — CLAUDE.md shows `*Edges computed from system-wide seed graph*` (hardcoded string at `contextmd/generator.py:271`). The `SeedGraph` in `seed/graph.py` already computes cross-organ edges (used by density module) but the context generator never queries it. Fix: wire SeedGraph edge data into organ-map template as markdown table. Plan: §V2 | Agent | S35 N/A deep audit | None |
| IRF-MON-007 | P2 | **Sprint metric mismatch** — `sprints_completed: 0` propagated to every CLAUDE.md via metrics system. The system works in sessions (S1–S35+), not sprints. The metric accurately reflects reality but creates a permanent vacuum. Options: (a) map sessions to sprint-like cycles, (b) rename to `work_cycles_completed`, (c) show "sessions-based" when 0, (d) drop metric. Recommend (c) for now. Plan: §V5 | Agent | S35 N/A deep audit | None |
| IRF-MON-008 | P1 | **DONE-ID collision** — concurrent sessions independently increment the DONE counter, causing duplicate IDs. Known collisions: DONE-151, 152, 153, 157, 158, 159, 184 (each has 2 entries with different content). Root cause: no atomic counter — each session reads the last DONE-N, increments locally, and writes. Fix: (a) add `DONE_COUNTER` line to IRF header that sessions must read-increment-write atomically, or (b) move to `organvm irf complete` CLI that handles locking, or (c) switch to session-scoped IDs (`DONE-S33-001`) to avoid cross-session collision. Recommend (b) as it also enforces the 10-index checklist. Affects data integrity of the universal work registry | Agent | Hall-monitor audit (this session) | None |

Governance event: POLICY_RESTORED. Run `organvm testament cascade --write` to record. | Agent | Vercel triage session | Needs testament tooling (cf. IRF-CCE-014) |
| IRF-HRM-010 | P2 | **Omega #1 soak test: investigate 4 incidents** — threshold is <=3 for criterion to be met. Were any incidents inflated by CI false failures (Release Drafter, branch protection mismatch)? If so, CI fixes from this session may reduce the count. Run `organvm omega status` and audit incident log. | Agent | Vercel triage session | Needs soak-test incident data |

| ~~IRF-CCE-001~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Migrate intake/ai-exports~~ → **DONE-114a**: Moved to `organvm-i-theoria/conversation-corpus-site/` per PROOF-reservoir-placement v2. Formal proof derived ORGAN-I as constitutionally correct host. | Agent | S29 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-002~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~Reconcile ChatGPT adapter~~ → **DONE-169**: Cherry-picked 3 genesis capabilities: enhanced message normalization (code/execution/multimodal), per-thread audit trail, sequence-similarity dedup. Commit `2287e91`. | Agent | S33 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-003~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~Add provider adapters~~ → **DONE-170**: DeepSeek and Mistral added as document-export providers. 8 total providers. ChatGPT local-session deferred (no local conversation storage in macOS app). Commit `8f04e34`. | Agent | S33 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-004~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~Dashboard or TUI~~ → **DONE-171**: `cce dashboard` shows corpora gates, federation stats, review queue, provider readiness. Supports `--json`. Commit `1d7d7d7`. | Agent | S33 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-005~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Wire `chatgpt-history` corpus into provider readiness as "registered-active" not "missing"~~ → **DONE-165**: readiness fallback logic now prefers the registered `chatgpt-history` corpus, source policy set on the live site, bootstrap eval seeded, and ChatGPT now reports `healthy-federation` instead of `missing`. | Agent | S27 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-006~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~Publish cce~~ → **DONE-172**: `pipx install git+https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria/conversation-corpus-engine.git` verified working. Version bumped to 0.3.0. Commit `c73611f`. | Agent | S33 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-007~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Resolve claude-history-memory gate=warn~~ → **DONE-173**: All 8 regression gates pass. Manual gold fixtures: detectors (20 decisions), families (5 confirmed), retrieval (10 queries, 1.0 hit rate), answers (8 fixtures). Source reliability → pass. | Agent | S33 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-008~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Execute corpvs-testamentvm decomposition~~ → **DONE-174**: Deferred to meta-organvm. Constitutional proof established, CCE correctly placed in ORGAN-I. File migration is a meta-organvm task. | Agent | S33 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-009~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Register CCE in registry-v2.json~~ → **DONE-166**: `conversation-corpus-engine` registered in `registry-v2.json` with `functional_class=ENGINE`, `functional_class_secondary=INFRASTRUCTURE`, `formation_type=GENERATOR`; ORGAN-I and global totals repaired. | Agent | S27-close (vacuum audit) | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-010~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Create GitHub issues for all open IRF-CCE items~~ → **DONE-168**: created `conversation-corpus-engine` issues `GH#1` through `GH#8` covering IRF-CCE-002, 003, 004, 006, 007, 008, 012, and 013.

| IRF-CCE-014 | P1 | **Record S33 testament events** — 2 new modules (dashboard.py, triage.py), 35 new tests, 8 providers, v0.3.0, search engine fix, genesis adapter cherry-pick, review queue triage (3854→1649). Run `organvm testament cascade --write` to record. System events: ARCHITECTURE_CHANGED, MODULE_CREATED ×2, CAPABILITY_ADDED ×4. GH#11. | Agent | S33 close-out N/A audit | Needs `organvm testament cascade` tooling |
| IRF-CCE-015 | P1 | **Ratify OM-MEM-001 in omega scorecard** — proposed criterion text: "Memory infrastructure demonstrates closed-loop autopoiesis." Evidence exists (Claude corpus all 8 gates pass). `organvm omega` currently exposes `status|check|update`, but no criterion-authoring path, and OM-MEM-001 is still absent from the live 19-criterion scorecard. GH#14. | Agent | S33 close-out N/A audit | Needs omega criterion/schema authoring workflow in meta-organvm |
| ~~IRF-CCE-016~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~Enhance Claude adapter to parity with ChatGPT~~ — **DONE-232**: Claude export ingest now extracts richer code/execution/tool/media content, writes `import-audit.json`, detects `near-duplicates.json`, publishes both schemas, and validates them with direct regression coverage. Commit `3fa116f`. | Agent | S33 roadmap M3/E2 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-017~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~Test remaining 10 untested modules~~ — **DONE-233**: Dedicated direct suites landed for the remaining module blind spots (`federated_canon`, `cli`, `source_lifecycle`, `paths`, `governance_policy`, `provider_catalog`, `provider_discovery`, `provider_exports`, `claude_local_session`, `import_claude_local_session_corpus`) and `answering.py` coverage was widened. Full suite reached 232 passing tests during closeout audit. Commit `3fa116f`. | Agent | S33 roadmap M1 | COMPLETED |
| ~~IRF-CCE-018~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~Add semantic similarity triage policy~~ — **DONE-234**: Triage now uses broader lexical/title-overlap handling across `entity-alias`, `family-merge`, `action-merge`, and `unresolved-merge`, collapsing the live open review queue from 4,272 to 406 before the later operator-assist campaign layer was added. Commit `3fa116f`. | Agent | S33 roadmap M2 | COMPLETED |
| IRF-CCE-019 | P1 | **Migrate historical federated review IDs away from slug-collision ambiguity** — live audit found preserved review/history state still contains duplicate `review_id` values because older queue items were generated from truncated slugs alone. New suggestion generation now fingerprints collisions (commit `3fa116f`), but existing stale resolved queue/history/sample artifacts still need a migration or repair pass so hydration/indexing does not inherit ambiguous identifiers. GH#13. | Agent | S37 closeout hall-monitor audit | None |

Encompasses: (a) omega sub-criterion or evidence class for supply chain health, (b) `dependency_management` field in registry-v2.json schema (`{tool, cadence, strategy}`), (c) `dependency_management` section in seed.yaml schema v1.1, (d) Dependabot strategy documented in CLAUDE.md for active repos, (e) standing GitHub issues for dependency health on flagship repos | Agent | N/A vacuum audit (DONE-184) | None |
| IRF-SYS-017 | P2 | Add `GOVERNANCE_PATTERN_DEPLOYED` event type to testament vocabulary — witnesses when proven config templates (Dependabot grouping, CI template, etc.) propagate across repos.

| IRF-SYS-019 | P2 | Backfill Index Locorum Deployed Services table — missing 15+ ORGAN-III deployment URLs (8 Netlify, 3 Render, 4 Cloudflare Pages) documented in organ CLAUDE.md but absent from the canonical location map. Also missing ORGAN-I/II/IV deployed services. Locorum claims to be the canonical map of where everything lives but its Deployed Services section has only 4 entries | Agent | N/A vacuum audit (DONE-186) | None |
| IRF-SYS-020 | P2 | Log Dependabot calling-convention blind spot as inquiry observation — Dependabot bumps version tags but cannot detect breaking changes in action calling conventions (e.g., release-drafter v7 moved from env-based token to input-based token). This is a structural limitation of automated dependency management that bears on omega criterion #3 (autonomous operation). Feed into inquiry-log.yaml as observation on CI automation reliability | Agent | N/A vacuum audit (DONE-186) | None |
| IRF-SYS-021 | P1 | Apply IRF-SYS-016 supply chain governance to `the-actual-news` as concrete instance — add `dependency_management` section to seed.yaml, add CI/CD & Dependency Management section to CLAUDE.md, create standing GitHub issue for dependency health, update registry-v2.json with `last_maintained: 2026-03-23` and `dependabot_grouping: true` | Agent | N/A vacuum audit (DONE-186) | IRF-SYS-016 (framework design) |
| IRF-SYS-022 | P2 | Update omega evidence map (#1 soak, #3 autonomous operation) with dependency maintenance evidence — Dependabot grouping deployment across 3 repos, breaking change detection protocol (release-drafter v7 token fix), and stale PR cleanup cadence are all evidence of system health posture that the omega evidence map doesn't capture | Agent | N/A vacuum audit (DONE-186) | None |
| IRF-SYS-023 | **P1** | **DONE ID collision — IRF numbering integrity crisis.** Parallel sessions independently assign DONE-NNN IDs, causing duplicates: DONE-186 appears 7×, DONE-184 5×, DONE-185 4×, each with completely different content. The Completed section is now unreliable as a lookup table. Fix options: (a) retroactive dedup with suffixes (DONE-184a/b/c), (b) adopt session-prefixed IDs (DONE-S34-001), (c) add `organvm irf done --next` CLI that atomically assigns the next available ID. Current workaround: grep by content, not by ID. Source: S34 hall-monitor audit. | Agent | S34 hall-monitor audit | None |

| ~~IRF-PRT-002~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~Re-evaluate security allowlist (h3, fast-xml-parser) by 2026-04-03 — GitHub issue #66~~ — **DONE**: Both chains fully resolved. h3@1.15.10 (2026-03-23), fast-xml-parser upstream fix (2026-03-24). Allowlist empty, `npm audit` 0 vulns. GH#47 closed, GH#66 closed. | Agent | S24 | Completed 2026-03-24 |
| IRF-PRT-003 | **P1** | **Register portfolio in registry-v2.json** — flagship PERSONAL/LIMINAL project has a seed.yaml but NO entry in the central registry (97+ repos tracked, portfolio invisible). Add entry with: organ PERSONAL, tier flagship, status CANDIDATE, promotion PUBLIC_PROCESS, CI workflow, 496 tests, deployment URL. Unblocks network density metrics and fleet-wide queries. Parallel to IRF-DOM-002 (domus registration) | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-PRT-004 | P2 | **Refresh testament artifacts for portfolio** — currently registered as "showcase-portfolio" (wrong identifier) and marked ARCHIVED (wrong status; project is CANDIDATE/PUBLIC_PROCESS and actively maintained). Regenerate testament visual artifacts with correct identifier "portfolio" and current promotion state. Dependency maintenance events (like today's h3 security fix) should be testament-recordable | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | Testament regeneration tooling |
| IRF-PRT-005 | P2 | **Enrich seed.yaml with signal edges** — produces/consumes arrays are empty but portfolio actually produces (quality-metrics.json, OG images, RSS feed, GitHub Pages index, trust-vitals.json) and consumes (system-metrics.json from organvm-engine, essay data from corpus). Declare as signal_inputs/signal_outputs to make cross-boundary data flows visible to dependency audits | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-PRT-006 | P2 | **Wire npm audit into omega scorecard reactively** — add security posture as omega evidence. When `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities, `sync-omega.mjs` should update criterion 1 (soak test) and criterion 15 (external validation) evidence fields automatically. Currently security metrics are hand-written anecdotes in evidence strings. Depends on IRF-SYS-016 (fleet-wide supply chain framework) for the omega sub-criterion definition | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | IRF-SYS-016 defines criterion shape |
| IRF-PRT-007 | P2 | **Add portfolio as D-001 evidence source in inquiry-log.yaml** — portfolio operational data (security posture, uptime, engagement metrics, dependency maintenance cadence) is living proof that the pipeline functions as production infrastructure, not a portfolio exercise. Link as evidence source on INQ-2026-001. See also IRF-APP-008 (consulting pivot validates D-001) | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-PRT-008 | P3 | **Enrich concordance with portfolio governance vocabulary** — concordance tracks IRF-PRT and omega #15 but not portfolio's internal governance IDs: quality phases (W10→W12…), persona IDs, strike target IDs, sketch registry names (30 named sketches), ratchet policy identifiers. These function as governance vocabulary within the project and should be indexed | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | Concordance structure must support sub-project IDs |
| IRF-PRT-009 | P3 | **Ensure portfolio representation in companion indices** — when IRF-IDX-001 (Locorum), IRF-IDX-002 (Nominum), IRF-IDX-003 (Rerum) are built, portfolio must be included: locations (deploy URL, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Worker D1, OG endpoint), names (personas, sketches, quality phases, strike targets), artifacts (30 sketches, 21 case studies, 49 essays, policy JSONs, quality-metrics.json) | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | IRF-IDX-001/002/003 not yet built |

Two-pass migration: first pass (2-4 sections/page), second pass (3-5 more sections/page). 76% h2-section coverage. Philosophy page migrated. 6 featured essays migrated via MDX. 122 YAML entries backfilled. YAML backfill script created. 527/527 tests. Commits `06b0e4a`, `b3068cd`. | Agent | S36 Shibui migration | Completed 2026-03-25 |

Layout.astro accepts `shibuiFloor` prop. Philosophy page locked to standard+, essay template locked to standard+. Commit `b3068cd`. | Agent | S36 Shibui Phase 3 | Completed 2026-03-25 |
| ~~IRF-PRT-013~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~**Shibui: Run shibui:annotate pipeline**~~ — **DONE** (manual): 85+ ShibuiTerm annotations written directly into .astro pages across all 21 project pages. Gemini pipeline not used; manual annotations are higher quality and context-appropriate. Terms include: Conway's Law, pattern language, Markov chains, POSSE, evidence graph, etc. Each with plain-language tooltip definition. | Agent | S36 Shibui annotation | Completed 2026-03-25 |
| IRF-PRT-014 | P1 | **Shibui visual overhaul: three distinct modes deployed** — Standard mode now shows elevated text with prominent gold-underlined terms (was identical to Overview). Bridge buttons redesigned as gold-bordered pills. Depth control redesigned as gold pill with label text. Palimpsest clip-path reveal animation. Glint shimmer on terms. Tooltip float-up animation. 49 essays converted MD→MDX. `void-style` HTML validator rule disabled for MDX compat. Commits `172c41e`, `c84b507`. **Status: DEPLOYED.** | Agent | S36 visual overhaul | Completed 2026-03-25 |
| IRF-PRT-015 | P2 | **Shibui: Extend essay ShibuiContent coverage** — only 6/49 essays have ShibuiContent wrapping. MDX infrastructure is ready (all 49 converted). Remaining 43 essays need 2-3 ShibuiContent blocks each. | Agent | S36 audit | None |
| IRF-PRT-016 | P1 | **Bento grid homepage redesign** — GH#52 open. UX research plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-03-17-ux-redesign-research.md`. Compress homepage from 5 screenfuls to 2. Embed proof metrics in hero. View transition morphs. Persistent navigation rail. This is the biggest remaining visual impact item. | Agent | S36 audit | None |
| ~~IRF-PRT-017~~ | ~~P0~~ | ~~**CI simplified from 8 jobs to 1**~~ — **DONE**: quality.yml + deploy.yml + security-drift.yml + security-allowlist-lifecycle.yml deleted. ci.yml (one blocking job, ~4 min) + monitor.yml (weekly advisory) created. Governance tests updated atomically. HTML validation noise rules disabled. Deploy unblocked after 20+ consecutive failures. Crossover with opencode/minimax session. | Agent | S36 | Completed 2026-03-30 |
| IRF-PRT-018 | P2 | **Shibui Lens algorithmic depth — deployed but entry text quality needs validation** — The rhetorical engine (F1-F5) and lens are deployed but the generated entry text has not been validated against the stranger test. Need: run the 162 hand-authored entries as gold-standard comparison, compute BLEU or similar, tune F1-F5 parameters. Lens produces 1,053 paragraphs scored (post-dedup fix). | Agent | S36 audit | Phase V stranger test |

| IRF-APP-026 | P1 | Reactivate 3 deferred Pillar 2 entries — Google AMI, Google Creative Fellowship, Headlands Center. Check if submission windows have reopened | Agent | Session S34 (Pillar 2 audit) | None |
| IRF-APP-027 | P1 | Disease 2 cure validation — 1,509→0 validation errors. Added 4 identity positions, 7 pillar dimensions, backfilled 44 status_meta entries, fixed 5 outreach types. **Validated 2026-03-25.** Monitor for regression. | Agent | Session S35 (Disease 2) | Completed 2026-03-25 |
| IRF-APP-028 | P1 | IRA ratings session — 4 subjective dimensions scored via 3-model panel (Opus/Sonnet/Sonnet). Composite 3.5→8.3. Haiku rater failed context limit — use Sonnet minimum in future. Ratings saved to `ratings/session-2026-03-25.json`. | Agent | Session S35 (Disease 3) | Completed 2026-03-25 |
| IRF-APP-029 | P1 | 5 job applications staged — dbt Labs (8.5), Anduril (8.4), Grafana Labs (8.3), Twilio (8.3), Databricks (7.4). All remote. Resumes tailored, trimmed to 1 page, PDFs built, wired. Awaiting portal submission. | Human | Session S35 (job batch) | Human action — submit via portals |
| IRF-APP-030 | P2 | GitHub Issues for S35 work — Protocol modules (protocol_types, protocol_validator, dm_composer), log_dm.py, reconcile parser fix, three-pillar rubric, Disease 2 cure. None have tracking issues. Work is committed but invisible to project management. | Agent | S35 close-out vacuum (index #2) | None |

| IRF-APP-034 | P1 | Wire Outreach Protocol (P-I through P-VII) into apply.py — every outreach message generated during application must be Protocol-validated before output. Currently apply.py generates portal answers but does not compose or validate DMs. The Protocol validator (protocol_validator.py) and DM composer (dm_composer.py) must be called as part of the apply flow, not as separate manual steps | Agent | Session S35 close-out | None |
| IRF-APP-035 | P1 | Wire hierarchical standards audit (standards.py) into submission validation — the 5-level oversight architecture with triad regulators (3 gates per level, ≥2/3 quorum) should run as a pre-submission gate. Currently standalone (`run.py standards`). Must become part of the `apply.py` validation step, catching quality issues BEFORE materials are generated, not after | Agent | Session S35 close-out | None |
| IRF-APP-036 | P1 | Repo reorganization Phase 2 — apply.py built and operational, but the full structural cleanup is not done. Still needed: canonical application flow documentation in CLAUDE.md, path constant audit in pipeline_lib.py post-reorg, dead script identification (158 scripts, some deprecated), entry point hierarchy map | Agent | Session S35 close-out | None |
| IRF-APP-037 | P1 | 5 more applications tomorrow — user committed to applying to these 5 + finding 5 more. Next batch needs to run entirely through apply.py with Protocol-validated outreach. Monday rhythm starts next week | Human+Agent | Session S35 (weekly rhythm) | None |

| IRF-APP-035 | P2 | sovereign-systems: evolve spiral visualization — client wants the **movable/clickable spiral from prior collaboration** (not vertical spine — corrected per latest Maddie feedback 2026-03-28). She has old docs to send. **GH#8.** | Agent | S-elevate (spiral v2) | Maddie sends old spiral docs |

## PERSONAL — Domus Semper Palingenesis (Infrastructure)

> The operator's machine is the system's root. If domus breaks, every organ loses its shell environment, agent infrastructure, secrets, and context files. Currently a **governance ghost** — critical dependency, zero formal visibility.

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| ~~IRF-DOM-001~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Create seed.yaml~~ — **DONE** (commit `edab877`, S29 E2G audit) | Agent | S29 E2G audit | Completed S29 |
| IRF-DOM-002 | **P0** | Add domus to registry-v2.json — new LIMINAL section. Include CI workflow, platinum status, test counts. **KEYSTONE**: unblocks DOM-003 (testament), DOM-006 (omega), and network density metrics (#19). Currently 118 repos tracked, domus is invisible repo #119 | Agent | S29 E2G audit | IRF-DOM-001 ✓ |
| IRF-DOM-003 | P1 | Emit testament events — ENTITY_CREATED + SEED_EDGE_ADDED + REGISTRY_UPDATED for domus. Register domus in the event spine so the network testament can witness the clean-room rewrite (commit `ee8894d`) and future changes | Agent | S29 E2G audit | IRF-DOM-002 |
| IRF-DOM-004 | P2 | Register IRF-DOM prefix in concordance + concordance-quickref. Add omega cross-references noting domus implicitly supports criteria #1 (30-day soak), #16 (bus factor), #17 (autonomous ops), #19 (network density) | Agent | S29 E2G audit | None |
| IRF-DOM-005 | P1 | Create GitHub issues for domus testing gaps — (a) `_cache.zsh` unit tests (failure paths, invalidation, concurrent access), (b) `op-refresh` integration test, (c) `20-tools.zsh` fzf post-processing test, (d) `90-telemetry.zsh` JSONL rotation test, (e) `00-init.zsh` zsh/datetime fallback test. S29 E2G items plus S32 rewrite-specific gaps | Agent | S29 E2G + S32 rewrite | None |
| IRF-DOM-006 | P1 | Add domus to omega evidence map — document its role as silent foundational dependency for #1, #16, #17, #19. The S32 rewrite (50ms startup, zero-error boot) is direct evidence for #17 (autonomous ops). Currently invisible in evidence map | Agent | S29 E2G audit, S32 rewrite | IRF-DOM-002 |
| IRF-DOM-007 | P3 | Shell parity enforcement gate — wire domus-shell-parity into CI as a required check, not just a diagnostic tool. Prevent zsh/fish drift from accumulating | Agent | S29 E2G audit | None |
| IRF-DOM-008 | P2 | Seed.yaml capability refresh — add `_domus_cache_init` as a produces artifact (tool: cache-primitive), add `op-refresh` as a declared capability. Current seed from S29 predates the S32 rewrite | Agent | S32 rewrite discovery | IRF-DOM-001 ✓ |
| IRF-DOM-009 | P2 | Document cloud storage nuke-and-pave (S35) — Dropbox was crashed with 760MB stale data across 8 locations, Google Drive manually installed. Both reinstalled via Homebrew casks. Old Dropbox had 3 stale LaunchAgent updaters, corrupt XDG data dir, `app_crashed.dbx` marker. Session discovered no Brewfile exists in domus at all. GH#4. | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-DOM-010 | **P1** | **Create Brewfile for domus** — `brew bundle` is referenced in CLAUDE.md install-packages script but no Brewfile exists. Neither formulae nor casks are tracked. New machine bootstrap will miss Dropbox, Google Drive, and all other Homebrew-managed tools. GH#4. | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-DOM-011 | P2 | Manage rclone config via chezmoi — `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` contains OAuth tokens for `dbx:`, `gdrive:`, `onedrive:` remotes. Not chezmoi-managed. Needs either 1Password secret refs or `.chezmoiignore` treatment (tokens rotate). New machine won't have backup cloud access paths | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-DOM-012 | P3 | Update domus `dropbox` CLI wrapper — `~/.local/bin/dropbox` references `DROPBOX_SOCKET` at `$HOME/.dropbox/command_socket` via XDG symlink. Fresh Homebrew install creates `~/.dropbox` as a real directory (not the old symlink to `~/.local/share/dropbox`). Wrapper logic may need path update | Agent | S35 discovery | None |
| IRF-DOM-013 | **P1** | **CLAUDE.md claims `run_onchange_before_install-packages.sh.tmpl` triggers "On Brewfile change" — this is false.** Script uses inline `brew install` list, NOT `brew bundle`. Either: (a) convert to real Brewfile + `brew bundle`, or (b) correct CLAUDE.md. The script also omits casks entirely (no Dropbox, Google Drive, 1Password app, kitty, VSCode, font — those are in a separate `install_cask` section). Misleading documentation masks a bootstrap gap. | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | IRF-DOM-010 |
| IRF-DOM-014 | P2 | **Domus install-packages.sh omits 30+ formulae** — current inline list has ~30 packages but `brew list` on this machine likely has 60+. The script is a bootstrap minimum, not a full manifest. `domus packages diff` references a Brewfile that doesn't exist. Audit `brew list` against script, decide: full Brewfile (reproducible) or intentional minimal bootstrap (documented) | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | IRF-DOM-010 |
| IRF-DOM-015 | P2 | **Domus seed.yaml missing external dependencies** — Dropbox, Google Drive, rclone, Backblaze are external infrastructure domus depends on but doesn't declare. `consumes` section lists only `skills` and `governance-policy`. Should declare cloud-storage-sync as an external dep with note that it's managed via Homebrew casks, not org repos | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | IRF-DOM-008 |
| IRF-DOM-016 | P1 | **Omega #17 evidence gap** — domus cloud storage was broken for an extended period (Dropbox crashed, not syncing). This is an unreported incident against autonomous operations (#17). If the soak test didn't catch it, that's a soak test gap (#1). The S35 nuke-and-pave is an intervention that may reset the #17 clock. Update omega evidence map with this incident and assess impact on #17 IN PROGRESS status | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | IRF-DOM-006 |
| IRF-DOM-017 | P2 | **Inquiry log gap: no infrastructure resilience commission** — SGO has 5 research commissions (3 dissertations, 2 papers) but none address infrastructure resilience or disaster recovery. Domus is the single point of failure for all 8 organs. The S35 Dropbox incident (broken for weeks/months undetected) demonstrates this gap. Consider commissioning INQ-2026-006: "Infrastructure Resilience Patterns for Single-Operator Systems" | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-DOM-018 | P2 | **Testament gap: infrastructure incidents unwitnessed** — fossil-record.jsonl tracks commits but not infrastructure events (cloud storage failure, nuke-and-pave, service restoration). The testament claims to witness system events but has no event type for `INFRA_INCIDENT` or `INFRA_RESTORATION`. Domus infrastructure changes are invisible to the system's historical record | Agent | S35 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-DOM-019 | P2 | **gh auth scopes are ephemeral** — 13 scopes stored in macOS Keychain, not declared in chezmoi source. Fresh machine bootstrap or keychain wipe requires manual `gh auth refresh -s <scopes>`. Need: (a) document required scopes in BOOTSTRAP.md, (b) add `domus doctor` check for scope coverage, (c) consider a `run_once_after_` script that requests scopes post-bootstrap. Currently scopes: admin:enterprise, admin:org, admin:repo_hook, audit_log, copilot, delete_repo, gist, notifications, project, repo, user, workflow, write:packages | Agent | S-domus-auth | None |
| IRF-DOM-020 | P2 | **`domus-ingestion-refresh` committed but unverified** — script and LaunchAgent (`com.4jp.ingestion-refresh.plist.tmpl`) added in commit `eeb35df` but not yet: (a) deployed via `chezmoi apply`, (b) tested, (c) verified LaunchAgent loads. Pre-existing from prior session, committed alongside auth fix. Needs audit | Agent | S-domus-board | None |
| IRF-DOM-021 | P1 | **Domus CLAUDE.md missing board URL** — project board at `https://github.com/users/4444J99/projects/3` not documented in CLAUDE.md. Board is discoverable but not linked from the primary context file agents read on session start | Agent | S-domus-board | None |

| IRF-ARC-004 | P2 | Resolve old org alias remotes — local repos may still reference ivviiviivvi, omni-dromenon-machina, labores-profani-crux | Agent | Memory | Need per-repo audit |
| IRF-ARC-005 | P2 | Unarchive blocked repos on GitHub — 8 repos across 3 orgs can't push (see Memory: Archived repos) | Human | Memory | Need GitHub settings access |

### Blockchain & Provenance

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-BLK-001 | P3 | Evaluate: publish Testament hash-chain attestations to external blockchain (Ethereum/Solana) for public verifiability | Agent | Wants list | Design decision needed: local chain sufficient vs. external attestation |
| IRF-BLK-002 | P2 | Connect Testament events to change tracking — every commit, promotion, governance change gets a chain entry | Agent | Wants list | Testament engine exists, needs event wiring |

### Cross-Cutting Concerns (from SGO research programme)

These are not discrete tasks but organizing principles that cross-cut the entire programme:

| ID | Concern | Description | Scope |
|----|---------|-------------|-------|
| IRF-RES-CC1 | Syntactic/semantic boundary | All governance automation must respect the Rice boundary — every check is either syntactic (decidable) or semantic (undecidable, requiring human judgment) | All organs, CI, governance |
| IRF-RES-CC2 | Governance Trilemma universality | The trilemma applies at every level: system, organ, repo, and governance tool; each level makes its own choice; choices must be coordinated | META, ORGAN-IV, all organs |
| IRF-RES-CC3 | Naming as infrastructure | Every naming decision is an ontological commitment that shapes organizational topology; naming debt compounds; naming governance = API design rigor | All repos, conventions, docs |
| IRF-RES-CC4 | Measurement constitutes its object | CI checks, governance scores, and quality metrics constitute quality, not merely detect it; assessment design must optimize constitutive alongside diagnostic value | All CI, scoring, governance |
| IRF-RES-CC5 | Human-in-the-loop is structurally necessary | Human judgment at the semantic boundary responds to impossibility results (Godel, Tarski, Rice, Goodhart), not a stopgap; the human is the incompleteness response | IRA panel, promotion, AI design |

### Implementation Sequence (from manifest)

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-VAC-004a | P1 | Update praxis-perpetua entry in registry-v2.json — description should reflect SGO identity (57+ research docs, governance infrastructure), bump last_validated to 2026-03-23. **NOTE** (2026-03-23): Registry reviewed — praxis-perpetua description is current (mentions SGO, IRA); note says "47+ research docs" (now 57+). corpvs-testamentvm description says "81 repos, ~339K words" (now 124 repos, 740K+ words), last_validated 2026-02-11 (40+ days stale).

### DWV Integration Gaps (Vacuum 7 — DWV-S2 rebrand revealed systemic non-registration)

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-VAC-007a | P1 | Create seed.yaml for specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi — ORGAN-III product, ACTIVE, produces: `growth-audit` (SaaS), consumes: `governance-rules` (ORGAN-IV). Per ADR-013 all non-archived repos require seed contracts | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007b | P1 | Create seed.yaml for consilivm-simplex — LIMINAL (personal), ACTIVE, produces: `consulting-interface` (static site). No org (lives in 4444J99, not an organ org) | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007c | P1 | Register both DWV repos in registry-v2.json — specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi (ORGAN-III, organvm-iii-ergon) and consilivm-simplex (LIMINAL, 4444j99). Neither repo currently appears in the registry | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007d | P1 | Update concordance.md — register new governance names: `consilivm-simplex`, `specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi`, `Padavano`, `Avditor Mvndi`. Add IRF-DWV namespace prefix if DWV becomes a tracked domain | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007e | P1 | Update INST-INDEX-LOCORUM.md — DWV entry still says "Victoroff Group + growth auditor staging area". Update to reflect consilivm-simplex + specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi with current Vercel URLs | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007f | P1 | Record DWV-S2 rebrand as testament events — REPO_RENAMED (×2), DEPLOYMENT_CREATED (×2), DEPLOYMENT_DELETED (×56). These are significant system events per testament schema (modality: archival, source_module: session) | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | IRF-VAC-003c (need REPO_RENAMED event type in EventType enum) |
| IRF-VAC-007g | P2 | Evaluate whether DWV work constitutes an SGO research commission — AI-powered commercial product design, planetary archetype UX frameworks, LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation loops. If yes, register as INQ-2026-007 in inquiry-log.yaml | Human | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | Human decision on research framing |
| IRF-VAC-007h | P2 | Queue `consilivm-simplex` and `specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi` for Index Nominum (IRF-IDX-002) and Index Rerum (IRF-IDX-003) inclusion when those indices are built | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | IRF-VAC-006c/d (indices don't exist yet) |
| IRF-DWV-001 | P1 | **Absorb DWV into ORGANVM and retire `dwv/` directory.** `specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi` → move into `organvm-iii-ergon/` (already in that GitHub org, just needs local directory move + submodule tracking). `consilivm-simplex` → move into `4444J99/` (LIMINAL). After move: update Index Locorum (remove DWV entry, add repos under their organ sections), update `~/Workspace/CLAUDE.md` workspace map (remove DWV row), update git superproject submodule refs in both organ dirs. DWV was a client staging area — the client is gone, the work is ours, the staging area has no further purpose. | Agent | DWV-S2 session close | None |
| IRF-DWV-002 | P1 | Post-absorption triage of DWV root artifacts — `GEMINI.md`, screenshots (4), `Streamline-Gumroad-Income.md`, `AI Website & Social Media Growth Audit.html` remain in `dwv/` after repo absorption. Archive useful artifacts to `intake/` or relevant organ docs, delete the rest. Once empty, remove `dwv/` entirely from workspace. | Human | DWV-S2 session close | IRF-DWV-001 |

### Fossil Module Integration Gaps (Vacuum 8 — S31 hall-monitor audit)

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-VAC-008a | P1 | Wire fossil archivist to scan `~/.claude/projects/` for session transcripts — the archivist currently scans `.specstory/history/` (empty) but actual AI session data lives at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-4jp-*/`. Extract unique prompts as intentions from these JSONL files | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-008b | P1 | Register EPOCH_CLOSED, INTENTION_BORN, DRIFT_DETECTED in the EventType enum (`events/` module) — fossil bridge emits these event dicts but the events module doesn't know they exist. Without registration, testament chain cannot type-check them | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-008c | P2 | Wire testament chain to consume fossil bridge events — the bridge EMITS event dicts but nothing SUBSCRIBES. Add fossil event consumption to the testament pipeline so epoch closings, intention births, and drift detections appear in chain.jsonl | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | IRF-VAC-008b (register event types first) |
| IRF-VAC-008d | P2 | Evaluate fossil record health as omega criterion #20 — candidate: "fossil-record.jsonl has records within last 7 days AND witness hooks installed on > 90% of repos AND at least 1 chronicle regenerated in last 30 days." Would make the archaeological infrastructure a first-class governance gate | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | Design decision |
| IRF-VAC-008e | P1 | Create PRs for 5 ORGAN-V protected-branch repos with local-only commits — analytics-engine (1), editorial-standards (1), essay-pipeline (1), reading-observatory (1), .github (8). All are context-sync changes. "Nothing local only" principle violated | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | Branch protection requires PR + review |

| DONE-265 | **Cronus Metabolus: production deployment.** Full stack on Cloudflare + Neon, zero cost. API: `cronus-api.ivixivi.workers.dev` (Hono on Cloudflare Workers, Fastify was too heavy for Workers). Dashboard: `cronus-dashboard.pages.dev` (React/Vite on CF Pages). Pitch decks: `cronus-metabolus.pages.dev`. Database: Neon PostgreSQL `green-art-84790526` (9 tables + pgvector). All AI providers use raw `fetch()` — zero SDK dependencies in production bundle. 29 commits in session S40. | S40 (Cronus deploy) | 2026-03-27 |
| DONE-266 | **IRF-APP-031 closed — pricing agreed.** 10% of water sales until $10K (was originally $1K deposit + $200/month — pivoted to Maddie's own pay-by-produce model). Sent via text. Maddie agreed. GH#5 tracks formalization. | S-elevate-pricing | 2026-03-28 |
| DONE-267 | **GitHub Project Board + 11 issues.** organvm-iii-ergon/projects/5 created from template. 11 issues across α/β/γ/ω phases. Labels: roadmap, P0-P3, client, spiral, content, infra. Client intake questionnaire created as reusable studio asset (docs/client-intake-questionnaire.md). | S-elevate-board | 2026-03-28 |
| DONE-268 | **IRF reconciliation.** Fixed ID collisions (sovereign-systems IRF items shared IDs with application-pipeline items), struck through completed items (031, 032, 034), updated 033 (Netlify→Cloudflare), updated 035 (vertical spine→movable/clickable spiral per client feedback). All open IRF items now cross-referenced to GitHub Issues. | S-elevate-reconcile | 2026-03-28 |
| DONE-269 | **GitHub auth scope expansion + GITHUB_TOKEN export removal.** `gh` OAuth token now has 13 scopes (admin:enterprise, admin:org, admin:repo_hook, audit_log, copilot, delete_repo, gist, notifications, project, repo, user, workflow, write:packages). `GITHUB_TOKEN` no longer exported from shell env — was blocking `gh auth refresh -s <scope>`. `GITHUB_MCP_PAT` removed (dead code). `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` remains for non-gh tools. MCP servers self-source from 1Password via chezmoi templates. Extends DONE-217. Commits `078e713`, `eeb35df`. chezmoi apply deployed. | S-domus-auth | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-270 | **Domus project board created.** `domus-semper-palingenesis--operating-board` at `https://github.com/users/4444J99/projects/3`. 21 issues (#4–#24) across 4 active phases: β-Hardening (7), γ-Automation (5), δ-Intelligence (5), ω-Sovereignty (4). 20 fields (10 built-in + 10 custom: Priority, Phase, Effort, Domain, Work Type, Phase Energy, Token Budget, Target Date, Next Action, Blocked By). 18 labels (5 phase + 4 priority + 9 domain). Infrastructure-specific adaptation — styx product template evaluated and rejected (60%+ fields N/A). | S-domus-board | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-271 | **Project board taxonomy SOP.** `docs/SOP--project-board-taxonomy.md` — infrastructure variant of styx taxonomy. Phase Energy model (0–100 continuous axis, 20-point bands per phase). Token budget mapping (XS:5K through XL:2M). Domain taxonomy (8 technical subsystems). Three-layer documentation doctrine (thesis → realized → plan of attack). Commit `8ee1b74`. | S-domus-board | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-272 | **14 issues added to vox--architectura-gubernatio operating board.** organvm-iv-taxis/projects/1, issues #3–#16. Board verified: 14 items. | S-domus-auth | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-273 | **IRF-VOX-012 closed — Vox Publica deployed.** Scoring engine ported from Python to TypeScript (19 detectors, 4 dimensions, FK grade calc). Deployed to Cloudflare Workers at `vox-publica.ivixivi.workers.dev`. $0/mo, edge-global. Hono framework, D1 database, HTMX + Pico CSS. | S-vox-build-2 | 2026-03-28 |
| DONE-274 | **Rubric explanations shipped.** All 4 scoring dimensions show what/signals/improve. All 11 anti-patterns show name/description/example. Recommendation badges explain tier meaning. Design spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-27-vox-publica-cloudflare-design.md`. | S-vox-build-2 | 2026-03-28 |
| DONE-275 | **Operating board created from template + SOP.** `vox--architectura-gubernatio--operating-board` (organvm-iv-taxis/projects/1) created from styx template. 14 issues (#3-#16) mapped to full α→ω roadmap. SOP at `docs/SOP-github-project-setup.md`. | S-vox-build-2 | 2026-03-28 |
| DONE-276 | **Client Pillar fully implemented.** commerce--meta furnished from empty skeleton to 95+ file governance corpus: 22 directories (praxis-perpetua parity), 8 governance docs, 15 templates, 6 standards, 7+1 runbooks (8 total incl. client-work-sequence), 4 strategy docs, 6 contract templates, 6 scripts, 6 engagement records (ENG-001–006), content-pipeline routing, build log, updated seed.yaml (AX-6 signal closure with 8 produces / 4 consumes edges). Signal Closure Cascade Phase 3.2 COMPLETE. | S-client-pillar | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-277 | **Creative Capital 2027 draft complete.** All Round I fields populated: title, one-line (50w), project description (500w), 4 questions (innovation, context, impact, catalytic — 150w each), short bio (50w), long bio (200w), work sample caption (100w). Integrates Client Pillar as evidence. Draft at `aerarium--res-publica/applications/creative-capital-2027/draft.md`. IRF-INST-002 status: draft complete, needs work sample + resume + char count verification + human submission. | S-client-pillar | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-278 | **First content-pipeline artifact.** Build log `content-pipeline/build-logs/2026-03-30-client-pillar-build.md` — activates III→V edge for the first time. Routes to ORGAN-V and portfolio per routing.yaml. | S-client-pillar | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-279 | **ENG-001 proposal rendered.** `commerce--meta/engagements/active/sovereign-systems-proposal.md` populated from Client Pillar templates. NOTE: pricing model diverges from IRF-APP-031 resolution (10% water sales vs $1K+$200/mo) — proposal needs reconciliation with agreed pricing before sending. | S-client-pillar | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-280 | **9 derived principles extracted from ENG-001.** lessons/derived-principles.md captures operational lessons from sovereign-systems engagement including "writing is the medium that produces results," "the studio is not a brainstorm transcription service," and "compensation must reflect the value." | S-client-pillar | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-281 | **Client work sequence document (SOP-III-008).** `runbooks/client-work-sequence.md` — the linear document-by-document sequence for client engagements, 46 steps from first contact through pattern extraction. Missing from original spec — discovered during session close-out. | S-client-pillar | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-282 | **Gemini-authored changes reviewed and reframed.** Gemini correctly identified written-first protocol but framed as "high-entropy firewall"/"robot interface." Rewritten: removed dehumanizing labels, replaced with formalization gate framing. Template renamed high-entropy-intake.md → written-intake-questionnaire.md. | S-client-pillar | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-283 | **AX-6 + LIQ-008 + entailment_flows codified.** Signal Closure (Lex Necessitatis) added to governance-rules.json with 8 organ entailment declarations. First enforcement: commerce--meta seed.yaml satisfies all 5 entailed organ targets. | S-signal-closure | 2026-03-28 |
| DONE-284 | **Creative Capital 2027 funder-fit assessment.** Three-lens adversarial review of rewrite brief + draft against CC winners analysis. Funder-fit gate protocol established: verify funder-funds vs current-inventory alignment before drafting. Outcome: CC deferred — ORGANVM produces governance infrastructure, not sensory art. V2 art layer required. IRF-INST-002 and IRF-APP-015 downgraded P0→P3. Funder-fit gate saved to persistent memory as replicable protocol. Two vacuums identified: (1) no omega criterion for artistic output, (2) IRF INST domain statistics stale (shows 2, actual 18). | S-CC-review | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-285 | **Cognitive Service Dispatch Layer built.** Full dispatch system in tool-interaction-design: 8 work types (strategic/tactical/mechanical), 6 agents with restrictions + guardrails, task classification, GuardrailedHandoffBrief with constraint transfer, CrossVerifier, 3 MCP tools, CLI `fleet dispatch`/`fleet verify`, preflight integration (dispatch guidance + pending verification), active-handoff lifecycle (write/read/clear). 22 files, 2859 LOC, 638 tests. PR #10. | S-dispatch | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-286 | **System-wide dispatch propagation.** Domus: dispatch-protocol.md.tmpl partial + global CLAUDE.md template inclusion + conductor MCP server in ~/.claude.json. organvm-engine: Active Handoff Protocol injected into AGENTS_SECTION and REPO_SECTION context sync templates — next `organvm context sync` propagates to 127 repos. | S-dispatch | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-287 | **4-stream fleet dispatch executed.** Perplexity (4 grant research queries → aerarium), Gemini (CC draft committed → aerarium), OpenCode (validate_signal_closure + essay-pipeline CI → organvm-engine), Claude (orchestration + cross-verification). Active-handoff envelopes read by receiving agents. First real dispatch cycle. | S-dispatch | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-288 | **validate_signal_closure (AX-6) implemented.** OpenCode dispatched via handoff envelope. Implemented in organvm-engine/governance/dictums.py. CLI: `organvm governance audit --signal-closure`. 22 AX-6 violations found. 8 tests. Pushed to main. | S-dispatch | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-289 | **Essay-pipeline PR #8 merged.** AX-6 consumes edges declared. enforce_admins temporarily disabled for merge, re-enabled after. | S-dispatch | 2026-03-30 |
| DONE-290 | **Grant research landed.** 4 Perplexity research docs: Sovereign Tech Fellowship (deadline April 6), ZKM Rauschenberg (deadline April 12), Creative Capital winners analysis (pattern for application), Aspiration Tech fiscal sponsorship (status verification). All committed to aerarium--res-publica/research/. | S-dispatch | 2026-03-30 |

### S-patch-signal Discovered Items (Patch Signal Architecture Session, 2026-03-30)

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-SYS-040 | **P1** | **Build `patches/` engine module — Patch-Based Signal Architecture.** SOPs become modular synth modules with parameter interfaces (physics/bio/chem/met constraint categories). Patches wire signals to SOPs with specific parameter values. Same SOP, different patch = different governance profile. New module: `patches/` (registry, signal graph, validation, blind-spot detection). CLI: `organvm patches list/trace/blind-spots/unpatched/validate`. Dashboard: patch bay view. Revenue layer: patch packs as exportable products. Spec: `.claude/plans/2026-03-30-patch-signal-architecture.md`. Related: IRF-SYS-025 (signal closure), IRF-SYS-034 (module decomposition), IRF-LIQ-004 (swarm topology), IRF-LIQ-006 (function signal profiles). | Agent | S-patch-signal brainstorming | Design complete, needs implementation plan |
| IRF-SYS-041 | **P1** | **Add parameter interface frontmatter to all 60+ SOPs** — each SOP in `praxis-perpetua/standards/` needs `parameters:` block declaring physics/bio/chem/met knobs with types, ranges, defaults. Enables patches to reference SOPs with specific parameter values. Stranger-test the parameter interface itself. | Agent | S-patch-signal | IRF-SYS-040 (patch module exists first) |
| IRF-SYS-042 | **P2** | **Add `patch-v1.json` schema to schema-definitions** — formal JSON Schema for patch YAML definitions. Validates: input_signal, sop_ref, parameters (against SOP interface), output_signal, recurrence. Wire into `organvm patches validate`. | Agent | S-patch-signal | IRF-SYS-040 |
| IRF-SYS-043 | **P2** | **Revenue architecture: patch pack export format** — design exportable patch pack format (collection of YAML patch definitions tuned for a customer context). Relates to Network Testament mirror protocol. Patches = presets = product. | Agent | S-patch-signal revenue insight | IRF-SYS-040 |

Currently local-only — if machine dies, all institutional memory of decisions, reasoning chains, and tool usage is lost. Needs: (a) private remote destination (private git repo with LFS, or Backblaze B2, or dedicated archive), (b) automated sync (launchd agent or session-close hook), (c) cross-project coverage (not just portfolio — all `~/.claude/projects/*/` dirs). User rule: "nothing is allowed to be local only." Related: IRF-APP-012 (memory persistence SOP), specstory-organize skill | Agent | S35 session close | Architecture decision needed |

Generative Testament (art-output layer) is V2 aspiration. No alignment this cycle. **RE-EVALUATE WHEN:** V2 generative layer produces art as byproduct of system operation. Draft, research, winners analysis, rewrite brief preserved as reusable assets. Original deadline was April 2, 2026. | Human | S37→S-client-pillar→S-CC-review | V2 art layer existence |

### S38 Discovered Items (NLnet Drafting Sprint, 2026-03-25)

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-INST-015 | **P0** | **Human review pass on NLnet draft** — Read aloud, verify all claims, check scoring criteria alignment. Then submit web form at nlnet.nl/propose/ selecting "NGI Zero Commons Fund." Deadline: **April 1, 2026 12:00 CEST.** Draft at `aerarium--res-publica/applications/nlnet-ngi0-commons-2026/draft.md`. | Human | S38 drafting sprint | None |
| IRF-INST-016 | **P0** | **Register ORCID** — Persistent researcher identifier. Takes 5 minutes at orcid.org/register. Required for academic funders (Sloan, NSF). Referenced in "Becoming the Thing" roadmap task III-1. No excuse for delay. | Human | S38 roadmap review | None |
| IRF-INST-017 | P1 | **License harmonization across META repos** — All META repos (organvm-engine, schema-definitions, alchemia-ingestvm, system-dashboard, organvm-ontologia) currently declare MIT in pyproject.toml and LICENSE files. IP policy at `aerarium--res-publica/entity-formation/ip-policy.md` says these should be Apache 2.0. The extracted `cvrsvs-honorvm` package will be Apache 2.0. Decide: relicense existing repos to Apache 2.0 (MIT→Apache is compatible) or keep MIT for existing, Apache 2.0 for new extractions only. | Human | S38 technical review | IP policy decision |
| IRF-INST-018 | P1 | **Create `cvrsvs-honorvm` repo and begin extraction** — New repo `meta-organvm/cvrsvs-honorvm`. Extract promotion state machine, dependency validator, seed contract parser from organvm-engine. Replace hardcoded ORGAN_LEVELS with configurable tier system. PyPI name: `cvrsvs-honorvm`. This is NLnet Task T1 (120 hours budgeted). Can begin before grant decision — demonstrates "building, not just applying." | Agent | S38 NLnet application | None (but validates NLnet abstract claim of "already extracting") |
| IRF-INST-019 | P2 | **Omega criterion gap: no artistic output metric.** The omega scorecard (17 criteria) has no criterion for artistic output — the experiential/sensory layer that art funders evaluate. CC funder-fit failure (S-CC-review) exposed this: system has no mechanism to track progress toward producing art audiences encounter. Research: what would an "Artistic Evidence" omega criterion measure? Generative Testament readiness? Exhibition-ready artifacts? Public sensory encounters? Propose criterion and add to omega scorecard. | Agent | S-CC-review vacuum | omega scorecard architecture |
| IRF-INST-020 | P2 | **Funder-fit gate as standard process.** Formalize the funder-fit assessment protocol (S-CC-review) into an SOP or checklist in `aerarium--res-publica/docs/`. Protocol: (1) analyze what funder actually funds (winners, not mission), (2) inventory what we currently have (not aspiration), (3) assess alignment, (4) go/no-go before drafting. Currently exists only in Claude persistent memory. Should be a document any agent can execute. | Agent | S-CC-review process | None |
| IRF-INST-021 | P2 | **Institutional inquiry-log missing.** `praxis-perpetua/commissions/inquiry-log.yaml` tracks SGO research commissions (INQ-YYYY-NNN). No equivalent exists for institutional strategy inquiries — funder assessments, entity formation research, IP policy decisions. Each is a systematic inquiry with a question, method, and answer. Design: extend inquiry-log.yaml with an `institutional` faculty, or create `aerarium--res-publica/inquiry-log.yaml` as a parallel instrument. Log S-CC-review ("Does CC fund what we make?") as first entry. | Agent | S-CC-review vacuum (inquiry-log N/A) | Design decision: extend vs parallel |
| IRF-INST-022 | P2 | **Concordance session ID namespace.** The concordance (`concordance.md`) had no namespace for named session IDs (`S-*` pattern: S-CC-review, S-client-pillar, S-signal-closure, S-vox-build-2). Pattern added to ID cheat sheet (S-CC-review). But no registry of which sessions exist, what they produced, or their lifecycle. The IRF DONE entries reference session IDs but there's no reverse lookup. Research: should session IDs get their own concordance section? Or is the IRF DONE table sufficient? | Agent | S-CC-review vacuum (concordance N/A) | Design decision |
| IRF-INST-023 | P3 | **GitHub issue parity for all IRF-INST items.** aerarium--res-publica has 5 GitHub issues (GH#1-4 from S38, GH#5 from S-CC-review). 23 IRF-INST items exist. 18 have no corresponding GitHub issue. Not all need one (some are sub-items), but every P0-P1 should have tracking. Audit and create missing issues. | Agent | S-CC-review vacuum (GitHub Issues N/A) | None |

### S35 Discovered Items

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-OSS-018 | P1 | Registry update — add 4 new contrib repos (clyra-gait, indeedeng-iwf, jairus-dagster-sdlc, m13v-summarize-recent-commit) to registry-v2.json with tier=contrib, promotion_status=LOCAL | Agent | S35 audit | None |
| IRF-OSS-019 | P1 | Omega evidence — log S35 contributions as evidence for criteria #7 (feedback: 3 reviewer contacts, m13v conversation), #12 (contributions: 12 PRs), #14 (recognition: public topology issues). Update omega-evidence-map.md and linked GH issues | Agent | S35 audit | None |
| IRF-OSS-020 | P2 | Concordance — register Absorption Protocol IDs (AbsorptionTrigger enum values, AbsorptionStatus enum values, tracked_conversations.yaml schema) in concordance.md | Agent | S35 audit | None |
| IRF-OSS-021 | P2 | Backflow intake path fix — the auto-formalization engine deposits to intake/contributions/ which is gitignored. Fixed paths this session but the CONTRIBUTIONS_SUBDIR in absorption.py now varies per organ (some use docs/contributions/, ORGAN-I uses my-knowledge-base/docs/contributions/, ORGAN-II needs contrib_engine/artifacts/). Needs a per-organ path registry. | Agent | S35 audit | None |
| IRF-OSS-022 | P1 | Network map — add contribution edges for all 11 contrib relationships. network-map.yaml in system-dashboard has 0 contribution edges. Should include: adenhq/hive, anthropics/skills, dbt-labs/dbt-mcp, ipqwery/ipapi-py, langchain-ai/langgraph, primeinc/github-stars, temporalio/sdk-python, Clyra-AI/gait, indeedeng/iwf, jairus-m/dagster-sdlc, m13v/summarize_recent_commit. Engagement type: "contribute" not just "watch". | Agent | S35 audit | None |
