# INST — Index Rerum Faciendarum

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2026-03-20
**Authority:** META — System-wide governance instrument
**Purpose:** Universal hanging index of things to be done — the canonical gap between what the system IS and what it NEEDS TO BE.

> *Index Rerum Faciendarum* — after the classical scholarly apparatus: *Index Locorum* (places), *Index Nominum* (names), *Index Rerum* (things). The gerundive *faciendarum* transforms reference into obligation: not things that exist, but things that must be made to exist.

### The Four Indices

This document is the first of a four-part classical index apparatus for ORGANVM:

| Index | Latin | Purpose | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Index Rerum Faciendarum** | *Things to be done* | Universal work registry — the gap between IS and NEEDS TO BE | **THIS DOCUMENT** |
| **Index Locorum** | *Index of places* | Canonical map of where everything lives — repos, directories, files, URLs, infrastructure endpoints, deployment targets | IRF-IDX-001 |
| **Index Nominum** | *Index of names* | Registry of all named entities — organs, repos, tools, agents, personas, regimes, orders, specifications, dissertations, people | IRF-IDX-002 |
| **Index Rerum** | *Index of things* | Ontological inventory of what exists — every artifact, its type, its state, its relationships, its provenance | IRF-IDX-003 |

Together, the four indices constitute a complete scholarly apparatus for the system: where things are (Locorum), what they're called (Nominum), what they are (Rerum), and what remains to be done (Rerum Faciendarum). The first three are reference instruments; this one is a governance instrument.

## How to Use This Document

This is a **living governance instrument**, not a snapshot. Every session that produces or discovers work items should update this index. The auditor (`vigiles_engine/auditor.py`) and the omega scorecard (`organvm omega status`) are the primary automated consumers.

**Update protocol:**
1. When a session closes, add completed items to `## Completed` with session ID and date.
2. When new work is discovered, add to the appropriate organ section with priority and source.
3. When work is blocked, move to `## Blocked` with blocking reason.
4. When work becomes irrelevant, move to `## Archived` with reason.

### Completion Logging — External Index Propagation

**REQUIRED:** When work is completed, it MUST be logged not only here but across ALL external indices with an interest. Every completion triggers this checklist:

| # | External Index | When to update | How |
|---|---------------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | **This document** (IRF) | Always | Move item to `## Completed` with session + date |
| 2 | **GitHub Issues** | If a GitHub issue exists for this work | Close the issue with comment referencing commit SHA + IRF ID |
| 3 | **Omega Scorecard** | If the work advances an omega criterion (#1-#19) | Run `organvm omega status` to verify; note criterion state change |
| 4 | **Inquiry Log** | If the work completes/advances an SGO research commission | Update `praxis-perpetua/commissions/inquiry-log.yaml` |
| 5 | **Testament Chain** | If the work is a significant system event (new module, repo, governance change, deployment) | Verify with `organvm testament status` |
| 6 | **Concordance** | If the work introduces or retires governance IDs | Update `docs/operations/concordance.md` |
| 7 | **Registry** | If the work changes repo state (new repo, status/tier change, new edges) | `organvm registry update` |
| 8 | **Seed contracts** | If the work changes repo capabilities, dependencies, or event subscriptions | Update the repo's `seed.yaml` |
| 9 | **CLAUDE.md** | If the work adds/changes modules, routes, tools, commands, or architecture | Update the repo's CLAUDE.md hand-written sections |
| 10 | **Companion indices** | If the work creates new locations (Locorum), names (Nominum), or artifacts (Rerum) | Update the relevant companion index when built |

Not every completion triggers every index. A P2 doc fix may only need #1 and #9. A new engine module needs #1, #2, #5, #7, #8, #9. Use judgment — but the DEFAULT is to check all 10 and consciously skip inapplicable ones, rather than unconsciously miss applicable ones.

**Priority tiers:**
- **P0 — NOW**: Human-gated or zero-cost unblocking actions. Do today.
- **P1 — SOON**: Next-session work. Clear path, no blockers.
- **P2 — GROWTH**: Extends existing capability. No deadline pressure.
- **P3 — HORIZON**: Future work. Requires design or prerequisites.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns (from SGO research programme)

These are not discrete tasks but organizing principles that cross-cut the entire programme:

| ID | Concern | Description | Scope |
|----|---------|-------------|-------|
| IRF-RES-CC1 | Syntactic/semantic boundary | All governance automation must respect the Rice boundary — every check is either syntactic (decidable) or semantic (undecidable, requiring human judgment) | All organs, CI, governance |
| IRF-RES-CC2 | Governance Trilemma universality | The trilemma applies at every level: system, organ, repo, and governance tool; each level makes its own choice; choices must be coordinated | META, ORGAN-IV, all organs |
| IRF-RES-CC3 | Naming as infrastructure | Every naming decision is an ontological commitment that shapes organizational topology; naming debt compounds; naming governance = API design rigor | All repos, conventions, docs |
| IRF-RES-CC4 | Measurement constitutes its object | CI checks, governance scores, and quality metrics constitute quality, not merely detect it; assessment design must optimize constitutive alongside diagnostic value | All CI, scoring, governance |
| IRF-RES-CC5 | Human-in-the-loop is structurally necessary | Human judgment at the semantic boundary responds to impossibility results (Godel, Tarski, Rice, Goodhart), not a stopgap; the human is the incompleteness response | IRA panel, promotion, AI design |
