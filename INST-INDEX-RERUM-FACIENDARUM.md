# INST — Index Rerum Faciendarum

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2026-03-20
**Authority:** META — System-wide governance instrument
**Purpose:** Universal hanging index of things to be done — the canonical gap between what the system IS and what it NEEDS TO BE.

> *Index Rerum Faciendarum* — after the classical scholarly apparatus: *Index Locorum* (places), *Index Nominum* (names), *Index Rerum* (things). The gerundive *faciendarum* transforms reference into obligation: not things that exist, but things that must be made to exist.

### The Four Indices

This document is the first of a four-part classical index apparatus for ORGANVM:

| Index | Latin | Purpose | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Index Rerum Faciendarum** | *Things to be done* | Universal work registry — the gap between IS and NEEDS TO BE | **THIS DOCUMENT** |
| **Index Locorum** | *Index of places* | Canonical map of where everything lives — repos, directories, files, URLs, infrastructure endpoints, deployment targets | IRF-IDX-001 |
| **Index Nominum** | *Index of names* | Registry of all named entities — organs, repos, tools, agents, personas, regimes, orders, specifications, dissertations, people | IRF-IDX-002 |
| **Index Rerum** | *Index of things* | Ontological inventory of what exists — every artifact, its type, its state, its relationships, its provenance | IRF-IDX-003 |

Together, the four indices constitute a complete scholarly apparatus for the system: where things are (Locorum), what they're called (Nominum), what they are (Rerum), and what remains to be done (Rerum Faciendarum). The first three are reference instruments; this one is a governance instrument.

## How to Use This Document

This is a **living governance instrument**, not a snapshot. Every session that produces or discovers work items should update this index. The auditor (`vigiles_engine/auditor.py`) and the omega scorecard (`organvm omega status`) are the primary automated consumers.

**Update protocol:**
1. When a session closes, add completed items to `## Completed` with session ID and date.
2. When new work is discovered, add to the appropriate organ section with priority and source.
3. When work is blocked, move to `## Blocked` with blocking reason.
4. When work becomes irrelevant, move to `## Archived` with reason.

### Completion Logging — External Index Propagation

**REQUIRED:** When work is completed, it MUST be logged not only here but across ALL external indices with an interest. Every completion triggers this checklist:

| # | External Index | When to update | How |
|---|---------------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | **This document** (IRF) | Always | Move item to `## Completed` with session + date |
| 2 | **GitHub Issues** | If a GitHub issue exists for this work | Close the issue with comment referencing commit SHA + IRF ID |
| 3 | **Omega Scorecard** | If the work advances an omega criterion (#1-#19) | Run `organvm omega status` to verify; note criterion state change |
| 4 | **Inquiry Log** | If the work completes/advances an SGO research commission | Update `praxis-perpetua/commissions/inquiry-log.yaml` |
| 5 | **Testament Chain** | If the work is a significant system event (new module, repo, governance change, deployment) | Verify with `organvm testament status` |
| 6 | **Concordance** | If the work introduces or retires governance IDs | Update `docs/operations/concordance.md` |
| 7 | **Registry** | If the work changes repo state (new repo, status/tier change, new edges) | `organvm registry update` |
| 8 | **Seed contracts** | If the work changes repo capabilities, dependencies, or event subscriptions | Update the repo's `seed.yaml` |
| 9 | **CLAUDE.md** | If the work adds/changes modules, routes, tools, commands, or architecture | Update the repo's CLAUDE.md hand-written sections |
| 10 | **Companion indices** | If the work creates new locations (Locorum), names (Nominum), or artifacts (Rerum) | Update the relevant companion index when built |

Not every completion triggers every index. A P2 doc fix may only need #1 and #9. A new engine module needs #1, #2, #5, #7, #8, #9. Use judgment — but the DEFAULT is to check all 10 and consciously skip inapplicable ones, rather than unconsciously miss applicable ones.

**Priority tiers:**
- **P0 — NOW**: Human-gated or zero-cost unblocking actions. Do today.
- **P1 — SOON**: Next-session work. Clear path, no blockers.
- **P2 — GROWTH**: Extends existing capability. No deadline pressure.
- **P3 — HORIZON**: Future work. Requires design or prerequisites.

Commit `86d505d`. | Agent | S24 | Completed S34 (h3 portion) |
| IRF-PRT-003 | **P1** | **Register portfolio in registry-v2.json** — flagship PERSONAL/LIMINAL project has a seed.yaml but NO entry in the central registry (97+ repos tracked, portfolio invisible). Add entry with: organ PERSONAL, tier flagship, status CANDIDATE, promotion PUBLIC_PROCESS, CI workflow, 496 tests, deployment URL. Unblocks network density metrics and fleet-wide queries. Parallel to IRF-DOM-002 (domus registration) | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-PRT-004 | P2 | **Refresh testament artifacts for portfolio** — currently registered as "showcase-portfolio" (wrong identifier) and marked ARCHIVED (wrong status; project is CANDIDATE/PUBLIC_PROCESS and actively maintained). Regenerate testament visual artifacts with correct identifier "portfolio" and current promotion state. Dependency maintenance events (like today's h3 security fix) should be testament-recordable | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | Testament regeneration tooling |
| IRF-PRT-005 | P2 | **Enrich seed.yaml with signal edges** — produces/consumes arrays are empty but portfolio actually produces (quality-metrics.json, OG images, RSS feed, GitHub Pages index, trust-vitals.json) and consumes (system-metrics.json from organvm-engine, essay data from corpus). Declare as signal_inputs/signal_outputs to make cross-boundary data flows visible to dependency audits | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-PRT-006 | P2 | **Wire npm audit into omega scorecard reactively** — add security posture as omega evidence. When `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities, `sync-omega.mjs` should update criterion 1 (soak test) and criterion 15 (external validation) evidence fields automatically. Currently security metrics are hand-written anecdotes in evidence strings. Depends on IRF-SYS-016 (fleet-wide supply chain framework) for the omega sub-criterion definition | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | IRF-SYS-016 defines criterion shape |
| IRF-PRT-007 | P2 | **Add portfolio as D-001 evidence source in inquiry-log.yaml** — portfolio operational data (security posture, uptime, engagement metrics, dependency maintenance cadence) is living proof that the pipeline functions as production infrastructure, not a portfolio exercise. Link as evidence source on INQ-2026-001. See also IRF-APP-008 (consulting pivot validates D-001) | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-PRT-008 | P3 | **Enrich concordance with portfolio governance vocabulary** — concordance tracks IRF-PRT and omega #15 but not portfolio's internal governance IDs: quality phases (W10→W12…), persona IDs, strike target IDs, sketch registry names (30 named sketches), ratchet policy identifiers. These function as governance vocabulary within the project and should be indexed | Agent | S34 N/A vacuum audit | Concordance structure must support sub-project IDs |

### Cross-Cutting Concerns (from SGO research programme)

These are not discrete tasks but organizing principles that cross-cut the entire programme:

| ID | Concern | Description | Scope |
|----|---------|-------------|-------|
| IRF-RES-CC1 | Syntactic/semantic boundary | All governance automation must respect the Rice boundary — every check is either syntactic (decidable) or semantic (undecidable, requiring human judgment) | All organs, CI, governance |
| IRF-RES-CC2 | Governance Trilemma universality | The trilemma applies at every level: system, organ, repo, and governance tool; each level makes its own choice; choices must be coordinated | META, ORGAN-IV, all organs |
| IRF-RES-CC3 | Naming as infrastructure | Every naming decision is an ontological commitment that shapes organizational topology; naming debt compounds; naming governance = API design rigor | All repos, conventions, docs |
| IRF-RES-CC4 | Measurement constitutes its object | CI checks, governance scores, and quality metrics constitute quality, not merely detect it; assessment design must optimize constitutive alongside diagnostic value | All CI, scoring, governance |
| IRF-RES-CC5 | Human-in-the-loop is structurally necessary | Human judgment at the semantic boundary responds to impossibility results (Godel, Tarski, Rice, Goodhart), not a stopgap; the human is the incompleteness response | IRA panel, promotion, AI design |

### Implementation Sequence (from manifest)

| A: Foundations | 1-4 | Structural preconditions | IRF-RES-001(DONE), 002(DONE), 011, 013, 005(DONE), 006, 012, 007 |

| IRF-VAC-007b | P1 | Create seed.yaml for consilivm-simplex — LIMINAL (personal), ACTIVE, produces: `consulting-interface` (static site). No org (lives in 4444J99, not an organ org) | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007c | P1 | Register both DWV repos in registry-v2.json — specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi (ORGAN-III, organvm-iii-ergon) and consilivm-simplex (LIMINAL, 4444j99). Neither repo currently appears in the registry | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007d | P1 | Update concordance.md — register new governance names: `consilivm-simplex`, `specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi`, `Padavano`, `Avditor Mvndi`. Add IRF-DWV namespace prefix if DWV becomes a tracked domain | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007e | P1 | Update INST-INDEX-LOCORUM.md — DWV entry still says "Victoroff Group + growth auditor staging area". Update to reflect consilivm-simplex + specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi with current Vercel URLs | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-007f | P1 | Record DWV-S2 rebrand as testament events — REPO_RENAMED (×2), DEPLOYMENT_CREATED (×2), DEPLOYMENT_DELETED (×56). These are significant system events per testament schema (modality: archival, source_module: session) | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | IRF-VAC-003c (need REPO_RENAMED event type in EventType enum) |
| IRF-VAC-007g | P2 | Evaluate whether DWV work constitutes an SGO research commission — AI-powered commercial product design, planetary archetype UX frameworks, LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation loops. If yes, register as INQ-2026-007 in inquiry-log.yaml | Human | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | Human decision on research framing |
| IRF-VAC-007h | P2 | Queue `consilivm-simplex` and `specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi` for Index Nominum (IRF-IDX-002) and Index Rerum (IRF-IDX-003) inclusion when those indices are built | Agent | DWV-S2 vacuum audit | IRF-VAC-006c/d (indices don't exist yet) |
| IRF-DWV-001 | P1 | **Absorb DWV into ORGANVM and retire `dwv/` directory.** `specvla-ergon--avditor-mvndi` → move into `organvm-iii-ergon/` (already in that GitHub org, just needs local directory move + submodule tracking). `consilivm-simplex` → move into `4444J99/` (LIMINAL). After move: update Index Locorum (remove DWV entry, add repos under their organ sections), update `~/Workspace/CLAUDE.md` workspace map (remove DWV row), update git superproject submodule refs in both organ dirs. DWV was a client staging area — the client is gone, the work is ours, the staging area has no further purpose. | Agent | DWV-S2 session close | None |
| IRF-DWV-002 | P1 | Post-absorption triage of DWV root artifacts — `GEMINI.md`, screenshots (4), `Streamline-Gumroad-Income.md`, `AI Website & Social Media Growth Audit.html` remain in `dwv/` after repo absorption. Archive useful artifacts to `intake/` or relevant organ docs, delete the rest. Once empty, remove `dwv/` entirely from workspace. | Human | DWV-S2 session close | IRF-DWV-001 |

### Fossil Module Integration Gaps (Vacuum 8 — S31 hall-monitor audit)

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-VAC-008a | P1 | Wire fossil archivist to scan `~/.claude/projects/` for session transcripts — the archivist currently scans `.specstory/history/` (empty) but actual AI session data lives at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-4jp-*/`. Extract unique prompts as intentions from these JSONL files | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-008b | P1 | Register EPOCH_CLOSED, INTENTION_BORN, DRIFT_DETECTED in the EventType enum (`events/` module) — fossil bridge emits these event dicts but the events module doesn't know they exist. Without registration, testament chain cannot type-check them | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | None |
| IRF-VAC-008c | P2 | Wire testament chain to consume fossil bridge events — the bridge EMITS event dicts but nothing SUBSCRIBES. Add fossil event consumption to the testament pipeline so epoch closings, intention births, and drift detections appear in chain.jsonl | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | IRF-VAC-008b (register event types first) |
| IRF-VAC-008d | P2 | Evaluate fossil record health as omega criterion #20 — candidate: "fossil-record.jsonl has records within last 7 days AND witness hooks installed on > 90% of repos AND at least 1 chronicle regenerated in last 30 days." Would make the archaeological infrastructure a first-class governance gate | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | Design decision |
| IRF-VAC-008e | P1 | Create PRs for 5 ORGAN-V protected-branch repos with local-only commits — analytics-engine (1), editorial-standards (1), essay-pipeline (1), reading-observatory (1), .github (8). All are context-sync changes. "Nothing local only" principle violated | Agent | S31 hall-monitor audit | Branch protection requires PR + review |

### Companion Indices Construction (Vacuum 6 — advances IRF-IDX-001/002/003)

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-VAC-006a | P1 | Design content schema for all three companion indices — what fields, inclusion criteria, cross-reference format, update protocol. Must handle: 118 repos, 188 citations, 67+ SOPs, 22 regimes, 57+ research documents | Agent | Vacuum analysis | None |
| ~~IRF-VAC-006b~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~Build INST-INDEX-LOCORUM.md v1 (IRF-IDX-001)~~ — **DONE** (545 lines, 123 repos mapped, all infrastructure endpoints, key files, data directories. Committed S31.) | Agent | Vacuum analysis | Completed S31 |
| IRF-VAC-006c | P1 | Build INST-INDEX-NOMINUM.md v1 (IRF-IDX-002) — registry of all named entities from registry-v2.json, seed.yaml files, governance docs, research programme, citation graph. Estimated 500+ lines | Agent | Vacuum analysis | IRF-VAC-006a (schema design) |
| IRF-VAC-006d | P2 | Build INST-INDEX-RERUM.md v1 (IRF-IDX-003) — ontological inventory of artifact types, states, relationships, provenance. Draws from ontologia UID system. Estimated 500+ lines | Agent | Vacuum analysis | IRF-VAC-006a (schema design) |
| IRF-VAC-006e | P2 | Build `organvm index generate` CLI (IRF-IDX-004) — automate index regeneration from registry, seeds, AST, ontologia. Different pipeline from existing indexer/ module | Agent | Vacuum analysis | IRF-VAC-006b/c/d (define target format) |

### S35 Discovered Items

| ID | Priority | Action | Owner | Source | Blocker |
|----|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| IRF-OSS-018 | P1 | Registry update — add 4 new contrib repos (clyra-gait, indeedeng-iwf, jairus-dagster-sdlc, m13v-summarize-recent-commit) to registry-v2.json with tier=contrib, promotion_status=LOCAL | Agent | S35 audit | None |
| IRF-OSS-019 | P1 | Omega evidence — log S35 contributions as evidence for criteria #7 (feedback: 3 reviewer contacts, m13v conversation), #12 (contributions: 12 PRs), #14 (recognition: public topology issues). Update omega-evidence-map.md and linked GH issues | Agent | S35 audit | None |
| IRF-OSS-020 | P2 | Concordance — register Absorption Protocol IDs (AbsorptionTrigger enum values, AbsorptionStatus enum values, tracked_conversations.yaml schema) in concordance.md | Agent | S35 audit | None |
| IRF-OSS-021 | P2 | Backflow intake path fix — the auto-formalization engine deposits to intake/contributions/ which is gitignored. Fixed paths this session but the CONTRIBUTIONS_SUBDIR in absorption.py now varies per organ (some use docs/contributions/, ORGAN-I uses my-knowledge-base/docs/contributions/, ORGAN-II needs contrib_engine/artifacts/). Needs a per-organ path registry. | Agent | S35 audit | None |
| IRF-OSS-022 | P1 | Network map — add contribution edges for all 11 contrib relationships. network-map.yaml in system-dashboard has 0 contribution edges. Should include: adenhq/hive, anthropics/skills, dbt-labs/dbt-mcp, ipqwery/ipapi-py, langchain-ai/langgraph, primeinc/github-stars, temporalio/sdk-python, Clyra-AI/gait, indeedeng/iwf, jairus-m/dagster-sdlc, m13v/summarize_recent_commit. Engagement type: "contribute" not just "watch". | Agent | S35 audit | None |
