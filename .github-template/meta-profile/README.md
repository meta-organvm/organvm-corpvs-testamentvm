## About

This is the umbrella organization for the organvm system. Each organ operates as an independent GitHub organization with its own repositories, governance, and domain focus. Together, they form a coordinated creative-institutional infrastructure.

- **Theory** (I) produces the epistemological and ontological frameworks
- **Art** (II) builds generative, interactive, and performance systems
- **Commerce** (III) packages and deploys revenue-generating products
- **Orchestration** (IV) governs cross-organ routing, promotion, and dependencies
- **Public Process** (V) publishes essays, methodology, and thought leadership
- **Community** (VI) manages collaborative spaces and member infrastructure
- **Marketing** (VII) handles content distribution and audience building
- **Meta** (VIII) provides the umbrella coordination layer
