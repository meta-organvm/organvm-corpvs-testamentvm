  "system_summary": "VERITAS II \u2014 97 repos (all on GitHub), 87 ACTIVE + 10 ARCHIVED, 9 flagship repos with full community health files, 41 essays (~150K words), CLAUDE.md across all active repos (100% AI-augmented workflow coverage), community health files inherited org-wide via 8 .github repos, POSSE distribution live, Jekyll site with RSS, 82+ CI/CD workflows, Astro portfolio site with 19 curated projects, 5 application packages, system-metrics.json dashboard, ~410K+ total words. Methodology: process-as-product, solo production at institutional scale, AI tools used as compositional instruments.",
  "strategic_context": "The eight-organ system coordinates 97 repos across 8 orgs with automated governance, dependency validation, and a promotion state machine. 41 essays document the methodology in real-time. Evidence supports applications across: (1) AI systems engineering roles (production-grade governance, autonomous infrastructure), (2) Creative/technical grants (sustained organizational capacity, process-as-product), (3) Technology residencies and fellowships (documented creative methodology).",
  "supporting_evidence": "Artists like Julian Oliver, Nicky Case, and Hundred Rabbits (Devine Lu Linvega & Rekka Bellum) treat protocols and governance structures as primary artistic output, demonstrating that small-scale sustainable creative infrastructure with extensive documentation receives institutional recognition (updated per 08-CANONICAL-ACTION-PLAN.md \u00a77). Programs like Knight Foundation Art+Tech Expansion Fund, Processing Foundation Fellowship, Google Creative Fellowship explicitly evaluate infrastructure contribution and organizational capacity.",
  "strategic_opportunity": "Position the eight-organ system as evidence of: (a) production-ready thinking (hiring), (b) long-term digital capacity and sustainability (grants), (c) community contribution and reusable infrastructure (residencies). All organs launch simultaneously to demonstrate integrated systems thinking.",
