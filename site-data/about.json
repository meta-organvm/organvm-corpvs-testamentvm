  "system_summary": "VERITAS COMPLETE \u2014 91 repos (all on GitHub), 87 ACTIVE (89.7% of non-archived) + 10 ARCHIVED, 8 flagship repos (4 SUBSTANTIAL, 2 PARTIAL), 36 essays, community health files across 8 orgs, POSSE distribution live, Jekyll site with RSS, 82+ CI/CD workflows, Astro portfolio site with 19 curated projects, 5 application packages, system-metrics.json dashboard, ~404K+ total words, aesthetic nervous system propagating taste.yaml across all organs, full provenance tracking (1,901 files classified). Credibility-hardened: honest status labels, split revenue fields, corrected essay dates.",
  "strategic_context": "Meta-system documentation (governance, orchestration, infrastructure) strengthens applications across: (1) AI systems engineering roles at research labs, (2) Creative/technical grants (NSF, NEA, Mellon, Knight Foundation), (3) Technology residencies and fellowships. This registry demonstrates orchestration capacity, architectural reasoning, and systemic sustainability\u2014competitive differentiators in 2026 funding landscape.",
  "supporting_evidence": "Artists like Julian Oliver, Nicky Case, and Hundred Rabbits (Devine Lu Linvega & Rekka Bellum) treat protocols and governance structures as primary artistic output, demonstrating that small-scale sustainable creative infrastructure with extensive documentation receives institutional recognition (updated per 08-CANONICAL-ACTION-PLAN.md \u00a77). Programs like Knight Foundation Art+Tech Expansion Fund, Processing Foundation Fellowship, Google Creative Fellowship explicitly evaluate infrastructure contribution and organizational capacity.",
  "strategic_opportunity": "Position the eight-organ system as evidence of: (a) production-ready thinking (hiring), (b) long-term digital capacity and sustainability (grants), (c) community contribution and reusable infrastructure (residencies). All organs launch simultaneously to demonstrate integrated systems thinking.",
