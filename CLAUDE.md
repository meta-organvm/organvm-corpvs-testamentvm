## What This Repository Is

This is a **planning and governance documentation corpus** — not a source code repository. It contains the complete planning, audit, and implementation record for an eight-organ creative-institutional system ("ORGAN I–VII + Meta") that coordinates 97 GitHub repositories across 8 GitHub organizations (7 organ orgs + 1 meta-org).

**Owner:** @4444j99 / @4444J99
**Status:** LAUNCHED (2026-02-11) — all 8 organs OPERATIONAL
**Repository:** `meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm`
**Documentation deployed:** ~404K+ words across 113 repos + 8 org profiles + 48 meta-system essays

There is no build system, test suite, or runtime code here. Executable artifacts include 5 validation scripts in `scripts/` and YAML/Python workflow specifications in `docs/implementation/github-actions-spec.md`.

## The Eight-Organ Model

| Organ | Domain | GitHub Org | Repos | Flagships |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| I | Theory (epistemology, recursion, ontology) | `organvm-i-theoria` | 20 | recursive-engine--generative-entity |
| II | Art (generative, performance, experiential) | `organvm-ii-poiesis` | 30 | metasystem-master, a-mavs-olevm |
| III | Commerce (SaaS, B2B, B2C products) | `organvm-iii-ergon` | 27 | public-record-data-scrapper |
| IV | Orchestration (governance, routing) | `organvm-iv-taxis` | 7 | orchestration-start-here, agentic-titan |
| V | Public Process (essays, building in public) | `organvm-v-logos` | 2 | public-process |
| VI | Community (salons, reading groups) | `organvm-vi-koinonia` | 4 | — |
| VII | Marketing (POSSE distribution, announcements) | `organvm-vii-kerygma` | 4 | — |
| VIII | Meta (umbrella org) | `meta-organvm` | 3 | organvm-corpvs-testamentvm |

## Key Invariants (Enforced Across All Documents)

1. **`registry-v2.json` is the single source of truth** — all repo state lives there
2. **No back-edges in dependency graph** — flow is I→II→III only; ORGAN-III cannot depend on ORGAN-II
3. **All 8 organs are represented at launch** — each organ has at least one flagship repo fully documented; remaining repos may launch as stubs or in-progress (compatible with Bronze/Silver/Gold tiered approach)
4. **Documentation precedes deployment** — no Phase 2 until Phase 1 is complete
5. **Every README is a portfolio piece** — written for grant reviewers and hiring managers, not just developers
6. **Promotion is a state machine** — LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC_PROCESS → GRADUATED → ARCHIVED (governs cross-organ promotion; repo documentation status uses a separate vocabulary: ACTIVE/DEPLOYED/SKELETON/EMPTY)

## TE (Tokens-Expended) Budget Model

Effort is measured in LLM API tokens, not human-hours. The AI-conductor model means: AI generates volume, human reviews and refines.

### Token Arithmetic
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters ≈ 0.75 words
- 3,000-word README ≈ 4,500 output tokens
- One generation pass (system + template + context + output) ≈ 15,000–20,000 tokens
- With 2–3 revision iterations + validation ≈ 50,000–90,000 tokens per README

### Per-Task TE Estimates
| Task Type | TE Budget |
|-----------|-----------|
| README REWRITE | ~72K TE |
| README REVISE | ~50K TE |
| README POPULATE | ~88K TE |
| README EVALUATE | ~24K TE |
| README ARCHIVE | ~12K TE |
| Essay (4,000–5,000 words) | ~120K TE |
| Validation Pass (per repo) | ~15K TE |
| GitHub Actions Workflow | ~55K TE |

### Phase Budgets
| Phase | TE Budget | Calendar |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Phase 1 (Documentation) | ~4.4M TE | Sprints 1–2 |
| Phase 2 (Validation) | ~1.0M TE | Sprint 3 |
| Phase 3 (Integration) | ~1.1M TE | Sprint 4 |
| **Total** | **~6.5M TE** | **Criteria-driven (D-08)** |

## Org Naming Architecture

Org names are **env-var-driven** for templating. The system uses a prefix + Greek ontological suffix scheme:

- **Template config:** `.config/organvm.env` (committed, provides defaults)
- **Instance config:** `.config/organvm.env.local` (gitignored, contains `ORGAN_PREFIX=organvm`)
- **Machine-readable:** `.config/organvm.config.json` (maps organ numbers to suffixes, env vars, domains)

All org references in docs, registry, and workflows use the resolved instance names (e.g., `organvm-i-theoria`). The template defaults use `${ORGAN_PREFIX}-i-theoria` etc.

## Working With This Corpus

- When editing `registry-v2.json`, maintain the existing JSON schema. Every repo entry has: `name`, `org`, `status`, `public`, `description`, `documentation_status`, `portfolio_relevance`.
- ORGAN-III repos additionally carry `type` (SaaS/B2B/B2C/internal) and `revenue` fields.
- The `docs/archive/` directory is frozen — do not modify v1 files; create v2+ variants in `docs/implementation/` instead.
- Documents `01`–`05` are sequentially numbered outputs of the master summary (`00-c`). They form a cohesive planning toolkit and cross-reference each other. They live in `docs/planning/`.
- The `docs/ANNOTATED-MANIFEST.md` provides an exhaustive per-file annotation of the entire directory and is the best starting point for understanding what each document contains.
- The execution plan is in `docs/strategy/roadmap-there-and-back-again.md` — the phased implementation roadmap from Phase -1 (org architecture) through Phase 3 (launch).
- The project constitution is at `docs/memory/constitution.md` — immutable principles (Articles I-VI) and post-cross-validation amendments (A-D) that govern all specifications and quality gates.
- Feature specifications live in `docs/specs/` — each deliverable (e.g., `docs/specs/bronze-sprint/`) contains a `spec.md` (requirements and success criteria) and `checklists/requirements.md` (validation checklist). The SDD methodology is defined in `docs/standards/11-specification-driven-development.md`.
- The **governance quadrilateral** is: roadmap (`docs/strategy/there+back-again.md`) + cadence (`docs/operations/operational-cadence.md`) + catalog (`docs/strategy/sprint-catalog.md`) + rolling TODO (`docs/operations/rolling-todo.md`). These four documents govern all planning and execution.
- **GitHub issue tracking:** 58 issues on `meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm` (omega criteria + sprint catalog) and 1 on `meta-organvm/organvm-engine` (scorecard fix). All omega criteria and unexecuted sprints have bidirectional links between issues and documentation.

## Invocation System

The governance corpus uses short IDs across 6 namespaces. When the user references an ID (e.g., "what's X1?", "show me AP-3", "which items advance #8"), look up context in `docs/operations/concordance.md`.

| Prefix | Namespace | Source | Example |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| X1–X4 | TODO: P0 hermetic seal | rolling-todo.md / e2g-ii | X1 = Submit Creative Lab Five |
| E1–E5 | TODO: P1 engagement | rolling-todo.md / e2g-ii | E3 = Google Creative Fellowship |
| M1-II–M6-II | TODO: P2 quality | rolling-todo.md / e2g-ii | M2-II = Stripe integration |
| S1-II–S6-II | TODO: P3 strategic | rolling-todo.md / e2g-ii | S2-II = Host first salon |
| G1–G3 | TODO: setup guide | rolling-todo.md | G2 = Render hosting |
| #1–#17 | Omega criteria | there+back-again.md | #8 = Product live |
| H1–H5 | Horizons | there+back-again.md | H3 = Generate Revenue |
| AP-1–AP-7 | Anti-patterns | operational-cadence.md | AP-1 = Don't start another sprint |
| W/SP/BS/LC/BL/ET/LO-II | E2G-II findings | e2g-ii-action-items.md | W1-II = Zero external contact |
| 01–33 | Completed sprints | docs/specs/sprints/ | 33 = OPERATIO |

CLI: `python3 scripts/invoke.py <ID>` for terminal lookup. See `docs/operations/concordance.md` for the full symbol table.

## AI-Conductor Workflow Model

This corpus operates on an **AI-conductor model**: human directs, AI generates volume, human reviews and refines. Key implications for working with these documents:

- **Word count targets** (3,000+ words, 2,500+ words, etc.) are quality specifications, not labor estimates. AI generates the volume; human ensures accuracy and voice.
- **Time estimates** reflect human review time for AI-generated drafts, not writing time.
- **Quality assurance** is AI validation (template compliance, link checking, cross-references) + human strategic review (accuracy, positioning, portfolio language).
- **AI-specific risks** to watch for: hallucinated code examples, generic boilerplate phrasing, incorrect cross-references, missing project-specific context.

## Naming and Path Conventions

The workspace uses a flat 2-level structure that mirrors GitHub exactly:
```
~/Workspace/<github-org>/<repo>/
```
e.g. `~/Workspace/organvm-i-theoria/recursive-engine--generative-entity/`

Repo naming pattern: `[organ]-[type]--[specific-name]` (double-dash separates type from name).

## Artifact Routing

When completing tasks across the organ system, use this decision tree to determine where files should land:

**Q1: Working repo (code/application)?**
→ `~/Workspace/<github-org>/<repo>/`
  e.g. `~/Workspace/organvm-i-theoria/recursive-engine--generative-entity/`

**Q2: Governance/planning/architecture doc for the organ system?**
→ This corpus (`~/Workspace/meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm/`), routed by document layer:

| Artifact type | Destination |
|---|---|
| Raw transcript / session log | `docs/genesis/` |
| Planning toolkit / audit | `docs/planning/` |
| Strategy / roadmap | `docs/strategy/` |
| Implementation spec / workflow | `docs/implementation/` |
| Evaluation / review | `docs/evaluation/` |
| Standard / methodology | `docs/standards/` |
| ADR (short decision record) | `docs/adr/` |
| Sprint spec | `docs/specs/<sprint>/` |
| Application / submission (canonical source) | `docs/applications/` (covenant-ark, tracker, strategy — source of truth for identity/metrics) |
| Application / submission (pipeline ops) | `~/Workspace/4444J99/application-pipeline/` (pipeline YAML, blocks, variants, conversion tracking) |
| Essay draft | `docs/essays/` |

**Q2b: Application materials?**
→ Application work is split between two locations:
- **Canonical identity, metrics, evidence:** Stay in `docs/applications/` (covenant-ark is the source of truth)
- **Pipeline tracking, composable blocks, variants, conversion analytics:** Go to `~/Workspace/4444J99/application-pipeline/`
- When metrics change, update `docs/applications/00-covenant-ark.md` first, then propagate to `application-pipeline/blocks/`

**Q3: Unsorted / temporary / exploratory?**
→ `~/Workspace/intake/` (universal catch-all; triage later)

**NEVER** land files in: `~/` (home) or directly in `~/Workspace/` (only org directories and non-organ projects belong at the top level).

## Parent Directory Context

This corpus lives at `~/Workspace/meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm/`, alongside `~/Workspace/meta-organvm/alchemia-ingestvm/` in the meta-organvm org directory. The old path `~/Workspace/organvm-pactvm/ingesting-organ-document-structure/` is deprecated (restructured 2026-02-16).

## Session Review Protocol

At the end of each session that produces or modifies files:
1. Run `organvm session review --latest` to get a session summary
2. Check for unimplemented plans: `organvm session plans --project .`
3. Export significant sessions: `organvm session export <id> --slug <slug>`
4. Run `organvm prompts distill --dry-run` to detect uncovered operational patterns

Transcripts are on-demand (never committed):
- `organvm session transcript <id>` — conversation summary
- `organvm session transcript <id> --unabridged` — full audit trail
- `organvm session prompts <id>` — human prompts only
