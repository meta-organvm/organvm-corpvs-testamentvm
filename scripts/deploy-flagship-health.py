"""Deploy community health files to flagship repos missing them.

Deploys CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, issue templates, PR template,
and (where needed) LICENSE to flagship repos in the organvm system.

Each CONTRIBUTING.md is customized per-repo with stack, setup instructions,
and project-specific contribution guidelines. SECURITY.md, issue templates,
and PR template follow a shared standard.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/deploy-flagship-health.py                # Deploy all missing files
    python3 scripts/deploy-flagship-health.py --dry-run      # Preview without deploying
    python3 scripts/deploy-flagship-health.py --repo NAME    # Deploy to one repo only
    python3 scripts/deploy-flagship-health.py --file TYPE    # Deploy one file type only
                                                             # (contributing, security, issues, pr, license)

### Monorepo Structure

This project is a monorepo managed by Turborepo. Key packages:

- `packages/` — Shared libraries and utilities
- `apps/` — Deployable applications (web, API)

When making changes, consider which package is affected. Run tests across
all packages before submitting a PR to catch cross-package regressions:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

## Overview

{repo.description}

**Stack:** {repo.stack}

## Prerequisites

- Git
- {prereq}
- A GitHub account

## Development Setup

{repo.setup_instructions}

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- Use the provided issue templates when available
- Include clear reproduction steps for bugs
- For documentation issues, specify which file and section

### Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines below
5. **Test** your changes:
   ```bash
   {repo.test_command}
   ```
6. **Commit** with a clear, imperative-mood message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "add validation for edge case in parser"
   ```
7. **Push** your branch and open a Pull Request
{monorepo_note}
### Code Style

{repo.code_style_notes}

### Commit Messages

- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Keep the title under 72 characters
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: "fix auth bug (#42)"
- Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the PR template with a description of your changes
2. Reference any related issues
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Request review from a maintainer
5. Address review feedback promptly

PRs should be focused — one feature or fix per PR. Large changes should be
discussed in an issue first.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and honest. This project is part of the
[organvm system](https://github.com/{repo.org}), which values transparency
and building in public. We follow the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

## Questions?

Open an issue on this repository or start a discussion if discussions are
enabled. For system-wide questions, see
[orchestration-start-here](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis/orchestration-start-here).

def generate_security(repo: FlagshipRepo) -> str:
    """Generate a standard SECURITY.md."""
    return f"""# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/{repo.org}/{repo.repo}/security/advisories/new)
to report vulnerabilities privately. This allows us to assess the risk and
prepare a fix before public disclosure.

If you are unable to use Security Advisories, you may email security concerns
to the repository maintainer directly.

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- The type of issue (e.g., injection, authentication bypass, data exposure)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information helps us triage and resolve the report quickly.

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours of receiving a report
- **Assessment:** Within 1 week of acknowledgment
- **Resolution:** Depends on severity; critical issues are prioritized

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest  | Yes       |

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** — API keys, passwords, tokens, or credentials
2. **Validate all inputs** — Sanitize user-supplied data
3. **Keep dependencies updated** — Review and apply security patches promptly
4. **Use HTTPS** — All external resources should be loaded over HTTPS
5. **Follow least privilege** — Request only the permissions you need

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters (with permission)
in our release notes.
